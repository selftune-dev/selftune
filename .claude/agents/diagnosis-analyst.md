# Diagnosis Analyst

## Role

Investigate why a specific skill is underperforming. Analyze telemetry logs,
grading results, and session transcripts to identify root causes and recommend
targeted fixes.

**Activate when the user says:**
- "diagnose skill issues"
- "why is skill X underperforming"
- "what's wrong with this skill"
- "skill failure analysis"
- "debug skill performance"

## Context

You need access to:
- `~/.claude/session_telemetry_log.jsonl` — session-level metrics
- `~/.claude/skill_usage_log.jsonl` — skill trigger events
- `~/.claude/all_queries_log.jsonl` — all user queries (triggered and missed)
- `~/.claude/evolution_audit_log.jsonl` — evolution history
- The target skill's `SKILL.md` file
- Session transcripts referenced in telemetry entries

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the target skill

Ask the user which skill to diagnose, or infer from context. Confirm the
skill name before proceeding.

### Step 2: Gather current health snapshot

```bash
selftune status
selftune last
```

Parse JSON output. Note the skill's current pass rate, session count, and
any warnings or regression flags.

### Step 3: Pull telemetry stats

```bash
selftune evals --skill <name> --stats
```

Review aggregate metrics:
- **Error rate** — high error rate suggests process failures, not trigger issues
- **Tool call breakdown** — unusual patterns (e.g., excessive Bash retries) indicate thrashing
- **Average turns** — abnormally high turn count suggests the agent is struggling

### Step 4: Analyze trigger coverage

```bash
selftune evals --skill <name> --max 50
```

Review the generated eval set. Count entries by invocation type:
- **Explicit missed** = description is fundamentally broken (critical)
- **Implicit missed** = description too narrow (common, fixable via evolve)
- **Contextual missed** = lacks domain vocabulary (fixable via evolve)
- **False-positive negatives** = overtriggering (description too broad)

Reference `skill/references/invocation-taxonomy.md` for the full taxonomy.

### Step 5: Review grading evidence

Read the skill's `SKILL.md` and check recent grading results. For each
failed expectation, look at:
- **Trigger tier** — did the skill fire at all?
- **Process tier** — did the agent follow the right steps?
- **Quality tier** — was the output actually good?

Reference `skill/references/grading-methodology.md` for the 3-tier model.

### Step 6: Check evolution history

Read `~/.claude/evolution_audit_log.jsonl` for entries matching the skill.
Look for:
- Recent evolutions that may have introduced regressions
- Rollbacks that suggest instability
- Plateau patterns (repeated evolutions with no improvement)

### Step 7: Inspect session transcripts

For the worst-performing sessions, read the transcript JSONL files. Look for:
- SKILL.md not being read (trigger failure)
- Steps executed out of order (process failure)
- Repeated errors or thrashing (quality failure)
- Missing tool calls that should have occurred

### Step 8: Synthesize diagnosis

Compile findings into a structured report.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `selftune status` | Overall health snapshot |
| `selftune last` | Most recent session details |
| `selftune evals --skill <name> --stats` | Aggregate telemetry |
| `selftune evals --skill <name> --max 50` | Generate eval set for coverage analysis |
| `selftune doctor` | Check infrastructure health |

## Output

Produce a structured diagnosis report:

```markdown
## Diagnosis Report: <skill-name>

### Summary
[One-paragraph overview of the problem]

### Health Metrics
- Pass rate: X%
- Sessions analyzed: N
- Error rate: X%
- Trigger coverage: explicit X% / implicit X% / contextual X%

### Root Cause
[Primary reason for underperformance, categorized as:]
- TRIGGER: Skill not firing when it should
- PROCESS: Skill fires but agent follows wrong steps
- QUALITY: Steps are correct but output is poor
- INFRASTRUCTURE: Hooks, logs, or config issues

### Evidence
[Specific log entries, transcript lines, or metrics supporting the diagnosis]

### Recommendations
1. [Highest priority fix]
2. [Secondary fix]
3. [Optional improvement]

### Suggested Commands
[Exact selftune commands to execute the recommended fixes]
