# SQLite-First Data Architecture

## Status

Most SQLite-first read-path work has landed, but this doc currently overstates the freshness cutover.

- Landed: hooks/sync write to SQLite, dashboard/status/report reads are primarily SQLite-backed.
- Still open: SSE invalidation is not yet WAL-only in the shipped runtime.
- Treat this document as migration design plus progress notes, not as a perfect description of current live freshness behavior.

## Problem

JSONL-as-source-of-truth caused:
- **9.5s dashboard load times** — materializer re-reading 370MB of JSONL on every request cycle
- **7-file change propagation** on schema changes (JSONL write, schema def, materializer, types, dashboard contract, route handler, tests)
- **Dual data paths** (JSONL tables vs SQLite tables) causing wrong-table bugs when queries hit stale materialized data
- **Stale dashboard data** — 15–30s TTL caches layered on top of the materializer masked the real latency

## Solution

3-phase incremental migration that inverts the data architecture from JSONL-first to SQLite-first.

**Phase 1: Dual-Write** — Hooks INSERT into SQLite alongside JSONL appends via `localdb/direct-write.ts`. Zero risk: additive only, fully reversible.

**Phase 2: Cut Over Reads** — Dashboard reads SQLite directly. Materializer is removed from the hot path for normal reads (runs once on startup for historical backfill). WAL-based SSE invalidation is the target end-state, but the shipped runtime still carries legacy JSONL watcher invalidation in `dashboard-server.ts`.

**Phase 3: Drop JSONL Writes** — Hooks stop appending JSONL. SQLite is the sole write target. A new `selftune export` command generates JSONL from SQLite on demand for portability.

## Architecture

Data flow (before):

```
Hook → JSONL append → [15s wait] → Materializer reads JSONL → SQLite → Dashboard
```

Target data flow (after full freshness cutover):

```
Hook → SQLite INSERT (via direct-write.ts) → WAL watcher → SSE broadcast → Dashboard
```

## Design Decisions

**DB Singleton (`localdb/db.ts`):** `getDb()` returns a shared connection. Avoids ~0.5ms open/close overhead per write. `_setTestDb()` allows test injection with `:memory:` databases.

**Prepared Statement Cache (`localdb/direct-write.ts`):** `WeakMap<Database, Map<string, Statement>>` caches parsed SQL per DB instance. ~10x faster for repeated inserts (hooks, batch ingestors).

**Fail-Open Writes:** All `direct-write.ts` functions catch errors internally. Hooks must never block the host agent — a failed SQLite write logs a warning and continues.

**JSONL Fallback for Tests:** Functions like `readAuditTrail()` fall back to JSONL when a non-default path is provided, preserving test isolation without requiring `_setTestDb()` everywhere.

**Two New Tables:** `queries` and `improvement_signals` were previously JSONL-only. Now first-class SQLite tables with dedup indexes.

**Route Extraction:** `dashboard-server.ts` split from 1205 → 549 lines. 7 route handlers extracted to `cli/selftune/routes/`.

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `cli/selftune/localdb/direct-write.ts` | Fail-open insert functions for all 11 tables |
| `cli/selftune/export.ts` | SQLite → JSONL export command |
| `cli/selftune/routes/*.ts` | 7 extracted route handlers + index |

## Files Modified

78 files changed, 2033 insertions, 1533 deletions. Key areas:

| Area | Files |
|------|-------|
| Hooks | All hook handlers (`hooks/*.ts`) — dual-write path |
| Ingestors | All platform adapters — dual-write path |
| Evolution | `evolution/*.ts` — read from SQLite, write via direct-write |
| Orchestrate + Grading | `orchestrate.ts`, `grading/*.ts` — SQLite reads |
| Dashboard | `dashboard-server.ts`, SQLite-backed routes, transitional SSE invalidation |
| CI | Workflow updated for new test structure |

## Impact

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Dashboard load (first call) | 9.5s | 86ms |
| Dashboard load (subsequent) | ~2s (TTL hit) | 15ms |
| Data latency (hook → dashboard) | 15–30s | target: <1s after WAL-only SSE cutover |
| Schema change propagation | 7 files | 4 files |
| Test delta | baseline | +2 passing, -2 failures |

## Limitations

- The WAL-only SSE cutover is not yet complete — legacy JSONL watcher invalidation still exists in the current runtime
- Phase 3 (drop JSONL writes) is not yet complete — dual-write is still active
- Historical data prior to Phase 1 requires a one-time materializer backfill on first startup
- `selftune export --since DATE` is supported for date-range filtering; per-skill filtering is not yet implemented
