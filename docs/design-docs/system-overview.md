# System Overview

This is the fastest way to understand how selftune works today.

## In One Sentence

selftune observes agent work from local transcripts and telemetry, rebuilds a trustworthy local record with `sync`, decides whether a skill needs help, deploys validated low-risk description fixes, watches for regressions, and exposes the loop through a local dashboard SPA.

## The Mental Model

selftune has four layers:

1. **Capture** — transcripts, rollouts, session stores, and hooks produce raw evidence.
2. **Normalize** — `selftune sync` rebuilds shared JSONL logs and repaired overlays.
3. **Decide and act** — grading, evolution, orchestrate, watch, and rollback use that evidence.
4. **Surface** — `status`, `last`, and the local SPA explain what the system knows and did.

## End-to-End System

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  User[Developer] --> Agent[Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode / OpenClaw]
  Agent --> Sources[Transcripts / rollouts / session stores]
  Agent -. low-latency hints .-> Hooks[Claude hooks]

  Sources --> Sync[selftune sync]
  Hooks --> RawLogs[Append-only JSONL logs]
  Hooks -. signal detection .-> Signals[improvement_signals.jsonl]
  Sync --> RawLogs
  Sync --> Repaired[Repaired skill-usage overlay]

  RawLogs --> Eval[Eval + grading]
  Repaired --> Eval
  Eval --> Orchestrate[selftune orchestrate]
  Signals -. boost priority .-> Orchestrate
  Orchestrate --> Evolve[Evolve / deploy / audit]
  Orchestrate --> Watch[Watch / rollback]

  RawLogs --> LocalDB[SQLite materialization]
  Repaired --> LocalDB
  Evolve --> LocalDB
  Watch --> LocalDB

  LocalDB --> Server[dashboard-server v2 API]
  Server --> SPA[Local dashboard SPA]
  Server --> CLI[status / last / badge]
```

## What Is Authoritative?

Hooks are useful, but they are not the main source of truth.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Hooks[Hook events] --> HintView[Low-latency hints]
  SourceStores[Transcripts / rollouts / session history] --> Sync[selftune sync]
  Sync --> Truth[Canonical local evidence]
  HintView -. enriches .-> Truth
```

### Practical rule

- Trust `selftune sync` before trusting `status`, `dashboard`, `watch`, or `orchestrate`.
- Treat hooks as convenience signal for Claude Code, not the canonical record for autonomous changes.

## What Happens During `selftune orchestrate`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant Orchestrate
  participant Sync
  participant Status
  participant Evolve
  participant Watch

  User->>Orchestrate: selftune orchestrate
  Orchestrate->>Sync: rebuild source-truth telemetry
  Sync-->>Orchestrate: shared logs + repaired overlay
  Orchestrate->>Status: compute current skill health
  Status-->>Orchestrate: candidates + reasons
  Orchestrate->>Evolve: validate and deploy low-risk description changes
  Evolve-->>Orchestrate: deployed proposals + audit trail
  Orchestrate->>Watch: monitor recent deployments
  Watch-->>Orchestrate: stable or rollback result
  Orchestrate-->>User: decision report
```

### Current autonomy posture

- Low-risk description evolution is autonomous by default.
- Validation is mandatory before deploy.
- Watch and rollback are the safety system after deploy.
- Review-required mode is optional policy, not the main product identity.

## What Happens When You Open The Dashboard

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Browser
  participant Server as dashboard-server
  participant DB as SQLite localdb
  participant Materializer as selftune sync/materialize

  Browser->>Server: GET /
  Server-->>Browser: SPA shell
  Browser->>Server: GET /api/v2/overview
  Server->>DB: overview query
  DB-->>Server: OverviewPayload
  Server-->>Browser: JSON
  Browser->>Server: GET /api/v2/skills/:name
  Server->>DB: skill report query
  DB-->>Server: SkillReportPayload
  Server-->>Browser: JSON
  Browser->>Server: GET /api/v2/orchestrate-runs
  Server->>DB: recent orchestrate runs query
  DB-->>Server: OrchestrateRunsResponse
  Server-->>Browser: JSON
  Browser->>Server: GET /api/v2/doctor
  Server-->>Browser: DoctorResult (config, logs, hooks, evolution health)
  Materializer->>DB: refresh from logs when sync/materialize runs
```

## Local vs Cloud Dashboard

The local dashboard and the cloud dashboard should not be treated as interchangeable copies of the same product surface.

- **Local dashboard:** machine-scoped operator/debug UI over local SQLite. It should answer whether this machine is capturing correctly, whether local evidence looks sane, whether uploads are queued or failing, and what this workspace has observed.
- **Cloud dashboard:** org-scoped control-plane and analysis UI over cloud auth plus canonical cloud storage. It should answer who is enrolled, which credentials exist, what landed in the cloud, and what org-level trends or operator decisions exist.
- If a concept appears in both places, one surface must be clearly authoritative. Local should own machine/runtime health; cloud should own org identity, enrollment, credentials, and remote analytics.

## Signal-Reactive Improvement

Beyond scheduled runs, selftune detects improvement signals in real-time.
When the prompt-log hook sees a correction ("why didn't you use X?") or
explicit request ("use the commit skill"), it logs a signal to
`improvement_signals.jsonl`. When the session ends, the session-stop hook
checks for pending signals and spawns a focused `selftune orchestrate
--max-skills 2` in the background. The orchestrator boosts signaled
skills in candidate selection and marks signals consumed after the run.

```
User: "why didn't you use the commit skill?"
  → prompt-log detects correction → writes signal
  → session ends → session-stop sees pending signals
  → spawns background orchestrate (focused on signaled skills)
  → next session: improved description catches the query
```

## Dashboard Package Architecture

The dashboard SPA consumes shared presentational components from `packages/ui/` (`@selftune/ui`), a source-only workspace package with no build step. The app shell in `apps/local-dashboard/` handles routing, data fetching, and theming. See [`packages/ui/README.md`](../../packages/ui/README.md) for the component API.

## The Main Local Artifacts

| Artifact | Role |
|---|---|
| `~/.claude/*.jsonl` | Shared append-only logs for telemetry, queries, repaired usage, and evolution audit |
| `~/.claude/orchestrate_runs.jsonl` | Persisted orchestrate run reports for CLI and dashboard inspection |
| `~/.claude/improvement_signals.jsonl` | Real-time improvement signals from user corrections and explicit skill requests |
| `~/.claude/.orchestrate.lock` | Lockfile preventing concurrent orchestrate runs (30-min stale threshold) |
| `selftune sync` | Rebuilds trustworthy local evidence from source systems |
| `cli/selftune/localdb/` | Materializes logs into SQLite tables and payload-oriented queries |
| `cli/selftune/dashboard-server.ts` | Serves the SPA and the v2 dashboard API |
| `packages/ui/` | Shared UI components, primitives, and types for dashboard SPAs |
| `apps/local-dashboard/` | Overview, per-skill report, system status/diagnostics UI |

## What selftune Is Not

- Not a hooks-only product
- Not a generic LLM tracing dashboard
- Not a cloud-first dependency for the core loop
- Not a human approval queue for routine low-risk description fixes
