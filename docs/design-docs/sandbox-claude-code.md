# Design Document: Claude Code Sandbox

**Status:** Implemented
**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Updated:** 2026-03-02
**Authors:** Daniel Petro
**Parent:** [Sandbox Architecture](sandbox-architecture.md)

## Overview

Claude Code-specific sandbox configuration, tests, and Docker container. See [sandbox-architecture.md](sandbox-architecture.md) for the shared two-layer architecture, HOME redirection trick, and fixture philosophy.

## Layer 1: Local Tests

**What it tests:**

| Command                                 | Expected Behavior                                        |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `doctor`                                | Config + logs validated, hooks detected in settings.json |
| `eval generate --skill find-skills`     | 6 positives, 24 negatives generated                      |
| `eval generate --skill frontend-design` | 0 positives (correctly identifies undertriggering)       |
| `status`                                | Colored table with per-skill health                      |
| `last`                                  | Latest session insight with unmatched queries            |
| `dashboard --export`                    | Standalone HTML with embedded data                       |
| `contribute --preview`                  | Sanitized contribution bundle                            |
| Hook: prompt-log                        | Record appended to all_queries_log.jsonl                 |
| Hook: skill-eval                        | `skill_invocation` appended to canonical log / SQLite    |
| Hook: session-stop                      | Record appended to session_telemetry_log.jsonl           |

**Performance:** 10 tests in ~400ms.

### Empty-State Install Test

`make sandbox-install` starts from a blank HOME and validates the real setup path:

- `selftune init --agent claude_code --cli-path <workspace-cli> --force`
- config file created under `~/.selftune/config.json`
- Claude hooks installed into `~/.claude/settings.json`
- `selftune doctor` reports `hook_settings` as passing
- re-running `selftune init` without `--force` is idempotent

This complements `make sandbox`, which is still a seeded smoke test against fixture data.

## Layer 2: Devcontainer + `claude -p`

**Location:** `tests/sandbox/docker/` (Docker files)

**Mechanism:** Uses `claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions` via the official Claude Code devcontainer. Extends the [official Claude Code devcontainer reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/devcontainer) with Bun runtime and sandbox HOME. Production code is unchanged and maintains zero dependencies.

**What it tests:**

| Command                                    | Expected Behavior                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `grade --skill find-skills`                | LLM evaluates session against expectations                     |
| `evolve --skill frontend-design --dry-run` | LLM proposes improved description                              |
| `watch --skill find-skills`                | Monitoring snapshot computed (no regression for healthy skill) |

### Test 1: Grade (`find-skills`, session-001)

Runs `selftune grade --skill find-skills --session-id session-001` which calls `claude -p` (real LLM call) to evaluate whether session-001 met two expectations:

1. "Skill was triggered"
2. "User query was about finding skills"

The LLM reads the session telemetry, sees that `find-skills` fired and `npx skills add brightdata/skills` was run, and grades each expectation with evidence. This is the **only test that uses LLM tokens** (~56 seconds). The grading output includes structured claims, evidence, and eval feedback suggesting improvements to the expectation set.

### Test 2: Evolve (`frontend-design`, dry-run)

Runs `selftune evolve --skill frontend-design --dry-run`. This is the "sick" skill — it has zero triggers across all 30 queries. Queries like "I need to make my website look better" and "improve the visual hierarchy of my landing page" should trigger it but don't.

The evolve pipeline runs but returns `"reason": "No failure patterns found"` because it needs graded sessions (not just missing triggers) to identify failure patterns. **No SKILL.md is modified** — `--dry-run` prevents deployment even if a proposal were generated. No LLM call is made (~70ms).

### Test 3: Watch (`find-skills`, no LLM)

Runs `selftune watch --skill find-skills` — pure computation, no LLM. Computes a monitoring snapshot from the fixture data:

- **pass_rate:** 0.2 (6 triggers out of 30 total queries)
- **baseline_pass_rate:** 0.5 (from evolution audit log)
- **regression_detected:** true (0.20 is below 0.50 minus the 0.10 threshold)
- Recommends `selftune evolve rollback --skill "find-skills"`

This correctly detects the regression scenario encoded in the fixture data (~30ms).

### What the tests validate

| Concern              | How it's validated                                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LLM integration      | `grade` calls `claude -p`, parses response, produces structured output |
| CLI argument parsing | All commands receive correct flags and produce valid JSON              |
| File I/O in sandbox  | Commands read from and write to the sandboxed HOME directory           |
| Evolution pipeline   | `evolve` reads skill files, analyzes logs, returns valid result        |
| Monitoring math      | `watch` computes pass rates and detects regressions from log data      |

### What the tests don't cover

| Gap                              | Why                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All 3 skills graded              | Only `find-skills` session-001 is graded (cost control)       |
| Actual skill rewriting           | `evolve --dry-run` never modifies SKILL.md                    |
| Rollback after regression        | `watch` detects regression but doesn't test `evolve rollback` |
| Multi-session grading            | Only 1 of 15 sessions is graded                               |
| `ai-image-generation` in Layer 2 | Only exercised in Layer 1 via `eval generate`                 |

These are candidates for future test expansion.

## Running

```bash
# Layer 1: Local (free, fast)
make sandbox
make sandbox-install

# Layer 2: First-time auth setup (one-time)
make sandbox-reset       # clear persisted Docker sandbox HOME if needed
make sandbox-reset-state # clear selftune state but keep Claude login
make sandbox-shell       # drop into provisioned container
make sandbox-shell-empty # drop into blank "white room" container
make sandbox-shell-empty-workspace # blank container, but selftune linked to /app
claude login             # paste token, then exit

# Layer 2: Run LLM tests (auth persists in Docker volume)
make sandbox-llm

# Interactive container access
make sandbox-shell

# White-room manual onboarding
make sandbox-reset-state
make sandbox-shell-empty

# White-room shell using the current workspace code
make sandbox-reset-state
make sandbox-shell-empty-workspace

# Full check: lint + unit tests + sandbox
make check
```

Use `sandbox-shell-empty` when you want a blank Claude/selftune state and plan
to install skills manually, then tell Claude "setup selftune" and observe the
actual onboarding path. Use `sandbox-shell` when you want the preseeded fixture
environment for repeatable functional checks.

Use `sandbox-shell-empty-workspace` when you want the same blank container state
but need Claude to run the selftune CLI and skill directly from the current
workspace at `/app` instead of from npm or a separately installed copy.

Use `sandbox-reset-state` when you want to keep Claude Code authenticated but
clear selftune config, hooks, logs, and installed skills from the sandbox.
Use `sandbox-reset` only when you want to wipe the entire sandbox HOME,
including Claude auth.

**Auth options:** `claude login` inside the container (persists in Docker volume), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.local`, or VS Code devcontainer.

## Future Work

- Add `ingest claude` command testing with simulated `~/.claude/projects/` transcripts
- Add `init` command testing with mocked `Bun.which()` for agent detection
