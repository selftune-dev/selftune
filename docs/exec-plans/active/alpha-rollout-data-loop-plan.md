# Execution Plan: Alpha Rollout and Data Loop Activation

<!-- Verified: 2026-03-18 -->

**Status:** In Progress  
**Created:** 2026-03-18  
**Goal:** Move selftune from “mechanics built” to “confidence building” by shipping a consent-based alpha rollout and a real multi-user data loop, while only fixing the dashboard/data-integrity issues that block trustworthy testing.

## Status Update — 2026-03-18

This plan has partially executed.

- **Phase A:** substantially complete
  - runtime identity landed in `/api/health` and the dashboard footer
  - hermetic path overrides now cover config/log/Claude/OpenClaw roots
  - the dev probe is stable again and no longer mutates `bun.lock`
  - rebuild preflight now blocks lossy rebuilds and reports SQLite-only row counts
- **Phase B:** complete for the current onboarding slice
  - alpha config/identity flow shipped
  - explicit consent/email flow is documented for the agent-facing init workflow
  - raw prompt/query text consent wording is now aligned with the friendly alpha cohort
  - plain `selftune init --force` preserves existing alpha enrollment
- **Phase C:** complete (cloud-realigned, hardened)
  - the initial D1 schema/type/doc spike landed, then fully realigned to cloud API
  - standalone Worker/D1 scaffold removed; pipeline targets `POST /api/v1/push` on the cloud API
  - auth model: `st_live_*` API keys via Bearer header
  - lossless canonical upload staging table (`canonical_upload_staging`) with single monotonic cursor
  - `stage-canonical.ts` reads canonical JSONL + evolution evidence + orchestrate_runs into staging
  - deterministic `execution_fact_id` and `evidence_id` generation during staging
  - `build-payloads.ts` reads from staging table, produces V2 canonical push payloads
  - HTTP client with Bearer auth and fail-open behavior (never throws)
  - flush engine: 409 (duplicate) treated as success, 401/403 as non-retryable auth errors
  - orchestrate_runs now staged and included in V2 push payloads
  - telemetry contract hardened with Zod schemas (`PushPayloadV2Schema` with `min(0)` arrays)
  - cloud API stores lossless `raw_pushes` before normalizing into canonical Postgres tables
  - `selftune alpha upload [--dry-run]` CLI command
  - upload step wired into `selftune orchestrate` (step 5, fail-open)
  - `selftune status` and `selftune doctor` show alpha queue health
  - e2e integration tests for the full upload pipeline

The next implementation target is **Phase D: Analysis Loop for Marginal Cases**.

## Executive Summary

The office-hours synthesis changes the priority order.

The main problem is not “build more product surface.” The main problem is that selftune still lacks enough real-world data to know what good looks like across users, skills, and workflows.

That means the next move should **not** be “start the entire dashboard-data-integrity-recovery plan end-to-end.” That plan is valid, but only part of it is a prerequisite for alpha.

The right sequence is:

1. Finish the **remaining trust-floor follow-ons** only where they still block alpha.
2. Treat the **consentful alpha onboarding flow** as landed for the current slice.
3. Build the **remote data pipeline** for opted-in alpha users.
4. Create a **tight operator loop** for Daniel to inspect marginal cases and learn from them.
5. Then return to the deeper dashboard/runtime cleanup that is not blocking alpha.

---

## Recommendation on the Existing Recovery Plan

**Do not start the full** [dashboard-data-integrity-recovery.md](dashboard-data-integrity-recovery.md) **first.**

Start only the parts of it that are direct alpha prerequisites:

- Phase 0: runtime identity and dev-server truth
- Phase 1: hermetic tests / proof harnesses
- Phase 2: lossy-rebuild guardrails and backup honesty

Defer the rest until after alpha data collection is live:

- WAL-based SSE freshness cleanup
- broader dashboard semantic cleanup
- deeper documentation realignment beyond what alpha needs

Reason: Ray’s synthesis says the bottleneck is confidence from data, not more mechanics. But alpha data is only useful if the data path is trustworthy.

## Planning Inputs

- office-hours-2026-03-18-synthesis.md (external strategy document)
- [dashboard-data-integrity-recovery.md](dashboard-data-integrity-recovery.md)
- [cloud-auth-unification-for-alpha.md](cloud-auth-unification-for-alpha.md)

---

## Target State

- Daniel can onboard 3-5 alpha users with explicit consent in minutes.
- Each alpha user has a stable local identity stored in `~/.selftune/`.
- Opted-in alpha data uploads to a shared backend with enough fidelity to analyze false positives, false negatives, and marginal cases.
- Local dashboards and stores are trustworthy enough that Daniel can validate what happened during alpha sessions.
- Tests and proofs cannot pollute the real operator store.
- Rebuild/backfill cannot silently drop recent data.

---

## Execution Order

### Phase A: Alpha Trust Floor

**Status:** Substantially complete

**Priority:** Critical  
**Effort:** Medium  
**Risk:** Low

This phase is the minimum cut of the dashboard recovery work required before recruiting testers.

**Scope:**

1. Expose runtime identity in `/api/health` and the dashboard UI. Completed.
2. Fix the `bun run dev` backend-health probe and startup race baseline. Probe fixed; startup wait is still optional follow-on work.
3. Make test/proof runs hermetic with environment-overridable storage roots. Substantially complete.
4. Add rebuild preflight/guardrails so recent SQLite-only rows cannot be silently discarded. Completed.

**Why this phase exists:**

- alpha data is useless if Daniel cannot tell which workspace/server he is looking at
- alpha data is dangerous if tests can leak into the real store
- alpha confidence collapses if rebuild can delete recent rows

**Completion criteria:**

- Daniel can identify workspace, DB path, log path, and watcher mode from the running dashboard
- `bun run dev` and `selftune dashboard` no longer create mystery backend mismatches
- proof/test runs leave `~/.selftune` and `~/.claude` untouched
- destructive rebuild aborts when it would be lossy

---

### Phase B: Consentful Alpha Onboarding

**Status:** Complete for current scope

**Priority:** Critical  
**Effort:** Medium  
**Risk:** Medium

**Primary outcome:** `selftune init` becomes the alpha enrollment point.

**Files likely involved:**

- `cli/selftune/init.ts`
- `cli/selftune/types.ts`
- `cli/selftune/constants.ts`
- `skill/Workflows/Initialize.md`
- `skill/SKILL.md`
- config/helpers under `cli/selftune/`

**Changes:**

1. Add an explicit alpha-consent flow during init:
   - explain that this is an alpha
   - explain what data is shared
   - explain that the purpose is improving selftune
2. Collect:
   - email
   - display name or optional label
   - consent timestamp
   - alpha participation flag
3. Persist a stable local user identity in `~/.selftune/`.
4. Keep the flow simple and skippable:
   - opted-in alpha user
   - local-only user
5. Update the agent-facing init docs to reflect the exact flow.

**Non-goals:**

- full public-launch anonymization
- enterprise-grade privacy workflows

**Completion criteria:**

- a new alpha user can complete init and enrollment in under 5 minutes
- identity and consent are stored locally and inspectable
- the skill docs tell the agent how to explain the alpha clearly

---

### Phase C: Remote Alpha Data Pipeline

**Status:** Complete

**Priority:** Critical
**Effort:** Large
**Risk:** Medium

**Primary outcome:** opted-in alpha data reaches a shared backend Daniel can analyze.

**Current state:** fully implemented. Local queue, payload builders, HTTP transport, CLI surface, orchestrate integration, and operator diagnostics are all shipped with 80 passing tests. The standalone Cloudflare Worker/D1 scaffold was replaced with direct integration into the existing cloud API's V2 push endpoint (`POST /api/v1/push`), authenticated with `st_live_*` API keys.

**Design direction (resolved):**

- The initial Cloudflare/D1 direction from the synthesis was evaluated and scaffolded, but was replaced with the existing cloud API to reduce operational surface and unify authentication
- Upload from opted-in clients only, authenticated with `st_live_*` API keys via Bearer header
- Local SQLite as source-of-truth cache, cloud API (Neon Postgres) as analysis sink

**Files likely involved:**

- new remote sync/upload module under `cli/selftune/`
- `cli/selftune/orchestrate.ts` or a dedicated uploader command/scheduler
- `cli/selftune/contribute/` if reused
- `cli/selftune/types.ts`
- docs and init workflow

**Changes:**

1. Define the alpha upload contract:
   - user ID
   - agent/platform metadata
   - skill invocation facts
   - prompt/query references needed for false positive / false negative analysis
   - evolution outcomes where relevant
2. Decide upload timing:
   - immediate best-effort
   - periodic batch
   - explicit sync
3. Add local queueing / retry behavior for failed uploads.
4. Add a simple operator view or CLI for upload status.
5. Keep consent enforcement local and explicit.

**Completed sub-split for this phase:**

1. local upload queue + watermark tracking
2. canonical upload staging (`stage-canonical.ts`) + payload builders
3. cloud API V2 push integration (replaced Worker/D1 direction)
4. upload-status visibility for operators

**Completion criteria:**

- Daniel can query remote data by user, time window, and skill
- failed uploads are visible and retryable
- an opted-out user sends nothing upstream

---

### Phase D: Analysis Loop for Marginal Cases

**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** Medium  
**Risk:** Medium

**Primary outcome:** Daniel can turn alpha data into learning, not just storage.

Detailed spike: [phase-d-marginal-case-review-spike.md](phase-d-marginal-case-review-spike.md)

**Changes:**

1. Build the four-quadrant analysis view around:
   - true positive
   - false positive
   - false negative
   - true negative
2. Prioritize operator views for:
   - likely false negatives
   - likely false positives
   - ambiguous/marginal cases
3. Add a lightweight review mechanism for marginal cases:
   - thumbs up/down
   - accepted/rejected label
   - optional note
4. Store those labels so future eval/evolution work can use them.

**Important note:**

This does **not** need to be a polished end-user product first. A Daniel-only operator surface is enough for the first cohort.

**Completion criteria:**

- Daniel can review and label marginal cases from alpha users
- labels are stored with enough context to feed later eval/evolution improvements

---

### Phase E: Alpha Cohort Operations

**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** Small  
**Risk:** Low

**Primary outcome:** the first 3-5 testers are actually live.

**Changes:**

1. Prepare a short alpha invite script and install script.
2. Create a tester checklist:
   - install
   - init
   - consent
   - verify upload
   - run normal work
3. Add a simple internal tracker:
   - who is active
   - when they were onboarded
   - whether uploads are flowing
   - notable skill failures or wins
4. Respond to Ray and any other volunteers with the alpha setup flow.

**Completion criteria:**

- 3-5 alpha users are onboarded
- at least 2 are generating real data regularly
- Daniel can inspect their uploads without custom debugging

---

### Phase F: Return to the Deferred Recovery Work

**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** Medium  
**Risk:** Medium

After alpha data is flowing, resume the deferred parts of the dashboard recovery plan:

- WAL-driven SSE freshness
- broader dashboard semantic cleanup
- final documentation alignment

This work still matters, but it should follow the data loop, not precede it.

---

## Completed Agent Splits

### Phase C (completed 2026-03-18)

Wave 1 (parallel):
1. **Agent 1:** Queue + watermark storage (20 tests)
2. **Agent 2:** Payload builder from SQLite (19 tests)
3. **Agent 3:** HTTP client + flush engine (15 tests)
4. **Agent 4:** Cloud API integration (replaced standalone Worker scaffold) (17 tests)

Wave 2 (after Wave 1):
5. **Agent 5:** CLI + orchestrate integration (10 tests)
6. **Agent 6:** Upload status + doctor diagnostics (17 tests)

### Next split suggestion

Phase D is the next active target:
1. **Agent 1:** Four-quadrant analysis view (TP/FP/FN/TN)
2. **Agent 2:** Labeling + review mechanism
3. **Agent 3:** Operator inspection flow (Daniel-only)

---

## Acceptance Criteria for Starting Alpha

Alpha is ready to begin when all of the following are true:

- Daniel can trust which runtime/store he is looking at
- tests cannot contaminate real data
- rebuild cannot silently lose fresh rows
- init can enroll a user with explicit consent
- opted-in data can reach the shared backend
- Daniel can inspect marginal cases from at least one non-Daniel user

Until then, the product is still in internal mechanics mode, not alpha-learning mode.
