## Priority Definitions

- **Critical**: Actively causing bugs or blocking features
- **High**: Will cause problems soon, should address this sprint
- **Medium**: Noticeable drag on velocity, schedule for cleanup
- **Low**: Minor annoyance, address opportunistically

## Process

1. New debt discovered → add row here
2. Background agents scan weekly for new debt
3. Cleanup PRs opened targeting highest priority items
4. Resolved debt marked as "Closed" with resolution date
