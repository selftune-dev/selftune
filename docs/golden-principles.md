# Golden Principles

Opinionated mechanical rules that encode human taste for selftune. These go beyond standard linters and are enforced in CI.

## Structural Rules

1. **Shared log schema is the contract**
   All three platform adapters write to the same JSONL schema. Schema changes require updating all writers and readers.

2. **Validate at boundaries, never YOLO**
   Parse and validate all external data at system boundaries: hook inputs, Codex JSONL streams, OpenCode SQLite rows. Never access unvalidated shapes.

3. **No external API keys required**
   Grading uses the user's existing agent subscription. selftune must never require a separate Anthropic API key or any other credential.

4. **Append-only logs**
   Log files are append-only JSONL. Never modify or truncate existing entries. Corrupted logs are skipped, not repaired.

5. **Zero-config hooks**
   After installation, hooks emit telemetry without configuration. No environment variables, no config files, no user action required.

6. **Bootstrap before operate**
   Every agent interaction starts with config. `selftune init` writes `~/.selftune/config.json` once; all workflows read it. No workflow should hardcode paths or assume agent type.

7. **Real signal over synthetic**
   Evolution proposals use real user queries as ground truth, never synthetic test prompts. Eval sets are generated from actual session data.

8. **Pure functions as shared backbone**
   Core computations (`computeMonitoringSnapshot`, `computeStatus`, `computeLastInsight`) are pure functions with no side effects. This enables reuse across CLI, dashboard, and monitoring surfaces without modification.

## Naming Conventions

- Files: kebab-case (`codex-wrapper.ts`, `grade-session.ts`)
- Functions: camelCase (`detectFalseNegatives`)
- Interfaces: PascalCase (`SessionTelemetryRecord`)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)
- Log fields: snake_case (`session_id`, `tool_calls`)

## Code Style

- TypeScript on Bun, zero runtime dependencies
- Strict types on all exported functions
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- No magic strings — use constants from `constants.ts`
- Error messages must be actionable (what happened, what to do)
- Functions do one thing
- Prefer early returns over deep nesting
- Template literals over string concatenation

## Testing Rules

- Every public function has at least one test
- Tests are in `tests/` mirroring source structure: `tests/hooks/prompt-log.test.ts`
- Test names describe the expected state, not the action
- No test interdependence — each test is isolated
- JSONL output is validated against schema in tests
- Run with `bun test`

## Documentation Rules

- Every design decision is documented with rationale
- Docs are verified against code on a recurring cadence
- Stale docs are worse than no docs — delete or update
- PRD.md is the source of truth for product decisions

## Evolution Rules

9. **Audit every state change**
   Every evolution proposal records `created`, `validated`, `rejected`, or `deployed` to the audit log. No silent transitions.

10. **Validate before deploy, always**
    A proposal must improve the eval pass rate with <5% regression before deployment. No exceptions, even with high confidence.

11. **Backup before overwrite**
    Every SKILL.md deployment creates a `.bak` backup. Rollback must always have a path — either backup file or audit trail.

12. **Dependency injection for testability**
    Evolution modules accept injectable dependencies (`_deps` parameter) so tests avoid `mock.module` contamination. Real imports are the default; tests inject mocks.

1. **Pre-gates before LLM grading**
    Deterministic checks (SKILL.md read, tools called, error count, session completed) run before the LLM grader. If all expectations resolve via pre-gates, the LLM call is skipped entirely. Pre-gate results are tagged with `source: "pre-gate"`.

2. **Graduated scores over binary pass/fail**
    Every grading expectation carries a `score` (0.0-1.0) alongside the binary `passed` boolean. Summaries include `mean_score` and `score_std_dev`. Default: `score ?? (passed ? 1.0 : 0.0)`.

3. **Pareto frontier for multi-candidate selection**
    When generating multiple proposal candidates, use Pareto dominance across invocation type dimensions (explicit, implicit, contextual, negative) to select the best candidate. Complementary candidates may be merged. All Pareto functions are pure — no I/O.

## Activation and Agent Rules

1. **Suggestions are advisory, never blocking**
    Auto-activation hooks suggest commands but never block the user prompt. Fail-open design: if the hook errors, the session continues uninterrupted.

2. **Evolution memory survives resets**
    The 3-file memory system (`~/.selftune/memory/`) persists context, plans, and decisions across sessions. `decisions.md` is append-only so history is never lost.

3. **Guardrails protect active evolutions**
    `evolution-guard.ts` blocks SKILL.md edits on monitored skills during active evolutions. Exit code 2 blocks with a message explaining why; never silent failure.

4. **Agents are pure markdown, cheap to create**
    Specialized Claude Code agents (diagnosis-analyst, pattern-analyst, evolution-reviewer, integration-guide) are markdown files with focused single-purpose instructions. Prefer narrow, single-purpose agents over general-purpose ones.

## Anti-Patterns

- Importing grading/eval modules from hooks (violates dependency direction)
- Importing monitoring modules from evolution (monitoring reads audit, not the reverse)
- Platform-specific logic in shared modules (belongs in ingestors)
- Requiring user configuration for basic telemetry capture
- Using synthetic queries when real session data is available
- Mutating log files after write
- Using `mock.module` for modules shared across test files (causes global contamination; use dependency injection instead)
- Deploying proposals without validation (even in "fast" or "confident" modes)
- Rollback without audit trail entry (silent reverts break observability)
- Hardcoding CLI paths in skill workflows (use `selftune <command>` directly)
- Running commands without checking for config first (init must precede all other commands)
- Importing from hooks/, ingestors/, grading/, evolution/, or monitoring/ in contribute/ (contribute is an isolated export path; enforced in `lint-architecture.ts`)
