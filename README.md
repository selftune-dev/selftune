# selftune

**Agent skills fail silently. selftune makes them self-correcting.**

Your skills trigger about half the time. A user says "make me a slide deck" and the pptx skill doesn't fire. No error. No log. The user blames the AI. You never find out.

This isn't a prompt engineering problem — it's a feedback loop problem. Skill descriptions are written once based on what developers *think* users will say, then never updated based on what users *actually* say.

selftune closes this loop. It observes real sessions, detects missed triggers, and evolves skill descriptions using your actual usage data — not vibes.

Works with **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **OpenCode**. Zero runtime dependencies.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Add the skill

```bash
npx skills add WellDunDun/selftune
```

### 2. Initialize

Tell your agent: **"initialize selftune"**

The agent installs the CLI if needed, runs `selftune init` to bootstrap config, installs hooks, and verifies with `selftune doctor`.

### 3. See your data

Tell your agent: **"replay my sessions and open the dashboard"**

This backfills logs from your existing transcripts and opens the skill-health dashboard — you'll see which skills are undertriggering within minutes of installing.

### Platform Notes

**Claude Code** — `selftune replay` backfills from existing transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/`. Hooks capture new sessions automatically after init.

**Codex** — Use the wrapper or batch ingestor:
```bash
selftune wrap-codex -- <your codex args>
selftune ingest-codex
```

**OpenCode** — Backfill from SQLite:
```bash
selftune ingest-opencode
```

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) or Node.js 18+. No extra API keys — selftune uses your existing Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode subscription for grading and evolution.

## The Problem

270,000+ agent skills exist across marketplaces. Most are unreliable because:

- **Skill descriptions don't match how people actually talk.** You wrote "generate PowerPoint presentation." Users say "make me some slides."
- **Missed triggers are invisible.** When a skill *doesn't* fire, there's no error, no log, no signal. You only know if someone complains.
- **Current fixes are workarounds.** Directive language hacks, forced-loading hooks, prompt engineering your own tools. None of these address the root cause.

selftune is the infrastructure-level solution. It doesn't hack around the problem — it measures it, diagnoses it, and fixes it automatically.

---

## How It Works

```
Observe → Detect → Diagnose → Propose → Validate → Deploy → Watch → Repeat
```

**1. Observe** — Hooks capture every session: what the user asked, which skills fired, what happened.

**2. Detect** — Cross-reference query logs against skill usage logs. Surface the queries where your skill *should* have fired but didn't.

**3. Diagnose** — Group failures by invocation pattern. "Users say X, Y, Z but the skill only matches A, B."

**4. Propose** — Generate an improved skill description via LLM, trained on your actual failure patterns.

**5. Validate** — Test the proposal against your eval set. Must improve overall. Less than 5% regression on existing triggers.

**6. Deploy** — Update SKILL.md with full audit trail. Every change is recorded.

**7. Watch** — Monitor pass rates post-deploy. Auto-rollback if performance drops.

This isn't a one-shot tool. It's a continuous loop that runs alongside your agent, making your skills better every week.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `selftune init` | Auto-detect your agent environment, bootstrap config |
| `selftune status` | See which skills are undertriggering and why |
| `selftune last` | Quick insight from your most recent session |
| `selftune evals --skill <name>` | Generate eval sets from real usage logs |
| `selftune grade --skill <name>` | Grade sessions: trigger accuracy, process quality, output quality |
| `selftune evolve --skill <name>` | Propose, validate, and deploy improved skill descriptions |
| `selftune watch --skill <name>` | Monitor post-deploy pass rates, auto-rollback on regressions |
| `selftune rollback --skill <name>` | Restore pre-evolution description |
| `selftune replay` | Backfill logs from existing Claude Code transcripts |
| `selftune contribute` | Export anonymized data for community signal pooling |
| `selftune dashboard` | Open a visual skill-health dashboard |
| `selftune doctor` | Health check on logs, hooks, config, and schema |

---

## What Makes This Different

| Approach | How it works | Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| **Directive language** | Write "ALWAYS invoke..." in SKILL.md | Brittle. One rewrite away from breaking. |
| **Forced-loading hooks** | Inject skill instructions on every prompt | Doesn't fix the description. Band-aid. |
| **Manual rewrites** | Developer guesses better phrasing | No data. No validation. No regression detection. |
| **selftune** | Measures real failures, proposes fixes, validates against eval sets, auto-rollbacks on regressions | Needs a few days of logs to build signal. |

selftune is the only tool that treats skill descriptions as living artifacts that evolve based on evidence.

---

## Tips

- Run `selftune init` first — everything else reads from the config it writes.
- Let logs accumulate a few days before running evals. More real queries = more reliable signal.
- All hooks are silent (exit 0) and take <50ms. Negligible overhead.
- Use `--dry-run` with `evolve` to preview proposals without deploying.
- Use `selftune contribute --preview` to inspect anonymized data before sharing.
- Use `selftune replay` to unlock months of existing signal immediately.

## Testing & Development

### Unit Tests

```bash
bun test
```

499 tests across 34 files. Runs in ~600ms.

### Sandbox Harness

The sandbox harness exercises every CLI command and hook against realistic fixture data in an isolated `/tmp` directory — your real `~/.claude/` and `~/.selftune/` are never touched.

```bash
make sandbox
```

Tests 3 real skills from [skills.sh](https://skills.sh): `find-skills` (healthy), `frontend-design` (undertriggering), `ai-image-generation` (newly installed). Runs 10 tests in ~400ms.

### Devcontainer + LLM Testing

For commands that require LLM calls (`grade`, `evolve`, `watch`), use the devcontainer with the Claude Code CLI. Based on the [official Claude Code devcontainer reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/devcontainer).

**First-time setup** (one-time, auth persists in a Docker volume):
```bash
make sandbox-shell       # drop into the container
claude login             # paste your token
exit
```

**Run LLM tests:**
```bash
make sandbox-llm
```

**Alternative auth:** Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env.local` at the project root.

**VS Code:** Open the repo and click "Reopen in Container" when prompted.

Uses the official Claude Code CLI with `claude -p`. Auth persists across runs — no need to log in again.

### All Checks

```bash
make check   # lint + architecture lint + unit tests + sandbox
```
