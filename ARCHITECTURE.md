# Architecture — selftune

selftune is a local-first feedback loop for AI agent skills. It turns saved agent activity into trustworthy local evidence, uses that evidence to improve low-risk skill behavior, and exposes the result through CLI surfaces and a local dashboard SPA.

## Agent-First Design Principle

selftune is a **skill consumed by AI agents**, not a CLI tool for humans. The user installs the skill (`npx skills add selftune-dev/selftune`), then interacts through their coding agent ("set up selftune", "improve my skills"). The agent reads `skill/SKILL.md` to discover commands, routes to the correct workflow doc, and executes CLI commands on the user's behalf.

This means:

- `skill/SKILL.md` is the primary product surface (agent reads this to know what to do)
- `skill/workflows/*.md` are the agent's step-by-step guides
- `cli/selftune/` is the agent's API (the CLI binary the agent calls)
- Error messages and output should be machine-parseable (JSON) and guide the agent to the next action

## Operating Rules

- **Source-truth first.** Transcripts, rollouts, and session stores are authoritative. Hooks are low-latency hints.
- **Shared local evidence.** Downstream modules communicate through SQLite (sole operational store) and repaired overlays. Legacy JSONL files are retained on disk for disaster recovery only.
- **Autonomy with safeguards.** Low-risk description evolution can deploy automatically, but validation, watch, and rollback remain mandatory.
- **Local-first product surfaces.** `status`, `last`, and the dashboard read from local evidence, not external services.
- **Alpha data pipeline.** Opted-in users upload V2 canonical push payloads to the cloud API via `alpha-upload/`. Uploads are fail-open and never block the orchestrate loop.
- **Generic scheduling first.** `selftune cron setup` is the main automation path (auto-detects platform). `selftune schedule` is a backward-compatible alias.

## Dependency Direction

Dependencies are intended to flow forward through the pipeline:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Shared[Shared types / constants / utils]
  Hooks[Hooks]
  Ingestors[Ingestors]
  Sync[Sync + repair]
  Eval[Eval]
  Grading[Grading]
  Evolution[Evolution]
  Orchestrate[Orchestrator]
  Monitoring[Monitoring]
  LocalDB[LocalDB]
  Dashboard[Dashboard]

  Shared --> Hooks
  Shared --> Ingestors
  Shared --> Sync
  Shared --> Eval
  Shared --> Grading
  Shared --> Evolution
  Shared --> Orchestrate
  Shared --> Monitoring
  Shared --> LocalDB
  Shared --> Dashboard

  Hooks --> Sync
  Ingestors --> Sync
  Sync --> Eval
  Eval --> Grading
  Eval --> Evolution
  Grading --> Evolution
  Evolution --> Orchestrate
  Evolution --> Monitoring
  Sync --> LocalDB
  Evolution --> LocalDB
  Monitoring --> LocalDB
  LocalDB --> Dashboard
```

Important practical interpretation:

- Hooks should not import grading or evolution code.
- The dashboard should consume payload-oriented queries, not rebuild business logic itself.
- The orchestrator should coordinate existing modules, not duplicate evolution or monitoring logic.

## Two Operating Modes

selftune has two distinct operating modes with different execution models:

### Interactive Mode (agent-driven)

The user talks to their coding agent. The agent reads `skill/SKILL.md`, routes
to the correct workflow, and runs CLI commands. The agent is the operator.

```
User: "improve my skills"
  → Agent reads SKILL.md → routes to Orchestrate workflow
  → Agent runs: selftune orchestrate
  → Agent summarizes results to user
```

### Automated Mode (OS-driven)

System scheduling (cron/launchd/systemd) calls the CLI binary directly.
No agent session needed, no token cost. Set up via `selftune cron setup`.

```
OS scheduler fires every 6 hours
  → selftune orchestrate --max-skills 3
  → sync → status → auto-grade ungraded → candidate selection → evolve → watch → write results to SQLite
  → Next interactive session sees improved SKILL.md
```

The agent is NOT in the loop for automated runs. This is intentional:
automated runs are routine maintenance (sync, low-risk evolutions) that
don't need agent intelligence or user interaction.

## Data Architecture

SQLite is the sole write target and operational database. Hooks and sync write
directly to SQLite via `localdb/direct-write.ts`. JSONL writes have been removed
(Phase 3 complete). Existing JSONL files are retained on disk but only cover
pre-cutover history. Post-cutover recovery requires `selftune export` snapshots
or SQLite backups. The `skill_usage` table still exists in the schema alongside
`skill_invocations` for backward compatibility; new consumers should use
`skill_invocations` via `localdb/queries.ts`.

```text
Primary Store: SQLite (~/.selftune/selftune.db)
├── Hooks write directly via localdb/direct-write.ts (sole write path)
├── Sync writes directly via localdb/direct-write.ts
├── All reads (orchestrate, evolve, grade, status, dashboard) query SQLite
└── Target freshness model: WAL-mode watch powers SSE live updates

Legacy JSONL files (~/.claude/*.jsonl) — pre-cutover history only, no longer written
├── session_telemetry_log.jsonl    Session telemetry records
├── skill_usage_log.jsonl          Skill trigger/miss records (deprecated; consolidated into skill_invocations SQLite table)
├── all_queries_log.jsonl          User prompt log
├── evolution_audit_log.jsonl      Evolution decisions + evidence
├── orchestrate_runs.jsonl         Orchestrate run reports
└── canonical_telemetry_log.jsonl  Normalized cross-platform records

Core Loop: reads SQLite
├── orchestrate.ts  → db.query("SELECT ... FROM sessions ...")
├── evolve.ts       → db.query("SELECT ... FROM evolution_audit ...")
├── grade.ts        → db.query("SELECT ... FROM sessions ...")
└── status.ts       → db.query("SELECT ... FROM sessions, skill_usage, queries ...")

Rebuild Paths:
├── materialize.ts  — runs once on startup for historical JSONL backfill
└── selftune export — generates JSONL from SQLite on demand

Alpha Upload Path (opted-in users only):
├── stage-canonical.ts  — reads canonical records from SQLite + evolution evidence + orchestrate_runs into canonical_upload_staging table
├── build-payloads.ts   — reads staging table via single monotonic cursor, produces V2 canonical push payloads
├── flush.ts            — POSTs to cloud API (POST /api/v1/push) with Bearer auth, handles 409/401/403
└── Cloud storage: Neon Postgres (raw_pushes for lossless ingest → canonical tables for analysis)
```

Hooks and sync write exclusively to SQLite. JSONL writes have been removed
(Phase 3 complete). All local product reads go through SQLite. The materializer
runs once on startup to backfill any historical JSONL data not yet in the
database. `selftune export` can regenerate JSONL from SQLite when needed for
portability or debugging.

The dashboard uses WAL-based invalidation for SSE live updates — JSONL file
watchers have been removed from the dashboard server.

## Truth Model: Hooks vs. Source Systems

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Hooks[Hook events] --> Hints[Low-latency hints]
  Stores[Transcripts / rollouts / session stores] --> Sync[selftune sync]
  Sync --> Truth[Trustworthy local evidence]
  Hints -. enrich .-> Truth
```

Why this matters:

- Hooks can be missing, polluted, or agent-specific.
- Source sync is how selftune stays cross-agent and backfillable.
- Autonomous changes should be justified from the synced evidence path, not from hooks alone.

## Autonomous Loop

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant Orchestrate
  participant Sync
  participant Status
  participant Evolution
  participant Monitoring

  User->>Orchestrate: selftune orchestrate
  Orchestrate->>Sync: rebuild source-truth telemetry
  Sync-->>Orchestrate: shared logs + repaired overlay
  Orchestrate->>Status: compute current skill health
  Status-->>Orchestrate: candidates + reasons
  Orchestrate->>Evolution: evolve selected low-risk descriptions
  Evolution-->>Orchestrate: deployed proposals + audit entries
  Orchestrate->>Monitoring: watch recent deployments
  Monitoring-->>Orchestrate: stable or rollback result
  Orchestrate-->>User: decision report
```

Current policy:

- Low-risk description evolution is autonomous by default.
- `--review-required` is an opt-in stricter policy mode.
- Validation, watch, and rollback are the main safety system.

## Signal-Reactive Improvement

In addition to scheduled and interactive orchestration, selftune detects
high-priority improvement signals in real-time and triggers focused
orchestration automatically.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant PromptLog as prompt-log hook
  participant SignalLog as improvement_signals (SQLite)
  participant SessionStop as session-stop hook
  participant Orchestrate

  User->>PromptLog: "why didn't you use the commit skill?"
  PromptLog->>SignalLog: append signal (correction, skill=commit)
  Note over PromptLog: continues normal prompt logging
  User->>SessionStop: session ends
  SessionStop->>SignalLog: read pending signals
  SessionStop->>Orchestrate: spawn background (--max-skills 2)
  Note over SessionStop: exits immediately (fire-and-forget)
  Orchestrate->>SignalLog: read signals, boost signaled skills
  Orchestrate->>Orchestrate: evolve with signal-aware priority
  Orchestrate->>SignalLog: mark signals consumed
```

Signal detection is pure regex in the prompt-log hook — no LLM calls, no
network. Patterns include corrections ("why didn't you use X?", "you
should have used X"), explicit requests ("please use the X skill"), and
manual invocations. Skill names are matched against the installed skill
directory listing.

The orchestrator boosts signaled skills by +150 priority per signal
(capped at +450) and relaxes the minimum evidence gate and UNGRADED gate
for skills with pending signals. After a run completes, signals are
marked consumed so they don't affect subsequent runs.

## Config System

`selftune init` writes `~/.selftune/config.json`.

| Tier 2 — Process | Did the session follow the expected workflow? | Yes                      |
| Tier 3 — Quality | Was the resulting work actually good enough?  | Yes, via agent-as-grader |

## Invocation Taxonomy

| Type       | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Explicit   | The user names the skill directly                 |
| Implicit   | The task matches the skill without naming it      |
| Contextual | The task is implicit with real-world domain noise |
| Negative   | Nearby queries that should not trigger the skill  |

## Current Known Tensions

- Candidate selection is improving, but still needs stronger real-world evidence gating.
- Local and cloud dashboard semantics should converge on the same payload contracts.
- The CLI core still avoids runtime dependencies, while the local SPA intentionally uses frontend build-time dependencies.
- OpenClaw cron remains supported, but it is no longer the primary automation story.
