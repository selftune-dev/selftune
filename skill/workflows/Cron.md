# selftune Cron Workflow

Set up scheduled automation for the selftune pipeline. Auto-detects the
platform (system cron, macOS launchd, Linux systemd) or can target
OpenClaw-specific cron integration.

## When to Use

- Setting up selftune automation for the first time
- Checking which cron jobs are registered
- Removing selftune cron jobs (cleanup or reconfiguration)
- Enabling the autonomous observe-grade-evolve-deploy loop

## Commands

### `selftune cron setup`

Auto-detect the current platform and install scheduled jobs.

| Flag                | Description                                                          | Default                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `--platform <name>` | Force a specific platform (`openclaw`, `cron`, `launchd`, `systemd`) | Auto-detect                       |
| `--dry-run`         | Preview without installing                                           | Off                               |
| `--tz <timezone>`   | IANA timezone for job schedules (OpenClaw only)                      | Flag > `TZ` env > system timezone |

Platform auto-detection: macOS → launchd, Linux → systemd, other → cron.

### `selftune cron setup --platform openclaw`

Register selftune cron jobs with OpenClaw. Requires OpenClaw installed and on PATH.

```bash
which openclaw    # Must resolve
```

### `selftune cron list`

Show all registered selftune cron jobs. Reads from
`~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json` and filters for `selftune-*` entries.
No flags.

### `selftune cron remove`

Remove all selftune cron jobs from OpenClaw.

| Flag        | Description                                          | Default |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `--dry-run` | Preview which jobs would be removed without deleting | Off     |

## Aliases

`selftune schedule` is an alias for `selftune cron`. Existing `selftune schedule`
invocations with flags (e.g. `selftune schedule --platform launchd`) continue to work.

## Default Job Schedule

Setup registers these jobs:

| Name                   | Cron Expression | Schedule         | Description                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `selftune-sync`        | `*/30 * * * *`  | Every 30 minutes | Sync source-truth telemetry                                       |
| `selftune-status`      | `0 8 * * *`     | Daily at 8am     | Health check — report skills with pass rate below 80%             |
| `selftune-orchestrate` | `0 */6 * * *`   | Every 6 hours    | Full autonomous loop: sync → candidate selection → evolve → watch |

All jobs run in **isolated session** mode — each execution gets a clean
session with no context accumulation from previous runs.

## Output

- **setup:** Installs platform-appropriate schedule artifacts and activates them
- **setup --platform openclaw:** Registers jobs via `openclaw cron add` and confirms each
- **list:** Prints a formatted table of registered selftune cron jobs (name, schedule, description)
- **remove:** Deletes each selftune cron job via `openclaw cron remove` and confirms

## Steps

1. Run `selftune cron setup --dry-run` to preview what would be installed
2. Run `selftune cron setup` to install scheduled jobs for your platform
3. Verify with `selftune status` after the first scheduled run fires

For OpenClaw specifically:

1. Run `selftune cron setup --platform openclaw --dry-run` to preview
2. Run `selftune cron setup --platform openclaw` to register jobs
3. Run `selftune cron list` to verify jobs are registered

## The Autonomous Evolution Loop

When scheduled jobs are active, selftune operates as a self-correcting system.
The OS scheduler calls the CLI binary directly — no agent session is needed,
no token cost for routine runs.

```text
OS scheduler fires (cron/launchd/systemd)
    |
    v
selftune run --max-skills 3           (CLI runs directly, no agent)
    |
    v
sync → candidate selection → evolve → validate → deploy → watch
    |
    v
Improved SKILL.md written to disk
    |
    v
Next interactive agent session uses updated description
```

This is distinct from interactive mode where the user says "improve my skills"
and the agent runs `selftune run`. Automated mode is for routine maintenance;
interactive mode is for user-directed improvements.

## Safety Controls

| Control              | How It Works                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dry-run first        | `selftune cron setup --dry-run` previews commands before installing                                                           |
| Regression threshold | Evolution only deploys if improvement exceeds 5% on existing triggers                                                         |
| Auto-rollback        | `selftune watch` automatically rolls back if pass rate drops below baseline minus threshold                                   |
| Audit trail          | Every evolution recorded in `evolution_audit_log.jsonl` with full history                                                     |
| SKILL.md backup      | `.bak` file created before every deploy — primary rollback path exists via .bak; fallback depends on audit metadata integrity |
| Human override       | `selftune evolve rollback --skill <name> --skill-path <path>` available anytime to manually revert                            |
| Pin descriptions     | Config flag to freeze specific skills and prevent evolution on sensitive skills                                               |

## Common Patterns

- **User wants autonomous skill evolution** -- Run `selftune cron setup`. Auto-detects the platform and installs appropriate scheduled jobs.
- **User specifies OpenClaw** -- Run `selftune cron setup --platform openclaw`.
- **User wants to preview before installing** -- Run `selftune cron setup --dry-run` to show exactly what would be installed without changing anything.
- **User needs a specific timezone (OpenClaw)** -- Run `selftune cron setup --platform openclaw --tz America/New_York`.
- **User asks what jobs are registered** -- Run `selftune cron list`. Shows a table of all selftune cron jobs with their schedules and descriptions.
- **User wants to remove cron automation** -- Run `selftune cron remove`. Preview first with `selftune cron remove --dry-run`.
- **Skill regressed after cron evolution** -- The watch job should catch this automatically. If not, run `selftune evolve rollback --skill <name> --skill-path <path>` manually. See `workflows/Rollback.md`.
