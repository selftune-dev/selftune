# selftune Orchestrate Workflow

Run the autonomy-first selftune loop in one command.

This remains the underlying runtime, but the simplified product surface should
teach it as `Run`.

`selftune orchestrate` is the current closed-loop entrypoint. It runs
source-truth sync, computes current skill health, selects candidates,
deploys validated low-risk description changes autonomously, and watches
recent changes with auto-rollback enabled.

If the user asks to "run selftune", "run the loop", or "operate autonomously",
route through `workflows/Run.md` first and use this file for the exact
underlying behavior and flags.

## When to Use

- You want the full autonomous loop, not isolated subcommands
- You want to improve skills without manually chaining `sync`, `status`, `evolve`, and `watch`
- You want a dry-run of what selftune would change next
- You want a stricter review policy for a single run

## Default Command

```bash
selftune run
selftune orchestrate
```

Autonomous evolve settings used by orchestrate:

```text
confidenceThreshold = 0.6
maxIterations = 3
paretoEnabled = true
candidateCount = 3
tokenEfficiencyEnabled = false
withBaseline = false
validationModel = haiku
cheapLoop = true
gateModel = sonnet
adaptiveGate = true
proposalModel = haiku
```

## Flags

| Flag                        | Description                                                | Default    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `--dry-run`                 | Plan and validate without deploying changes                | Off        |
| `--review-required`         | Keep validated changes in review mode instead of deploying | Off        |
| `--auto-approve`            | _(Deprecated)_ Autonomous mode is now the default          | —          |
| `--skill <name>`            | Limit the loop to one skill                                | All skills |
| `--max-skills <n>`          | Cap how many candidates are processed in one run           | `5`        |
| `--recent-window <hours>`   | Window for post-deploy watch/rollback checks               | `48`       |
| `--sync-force`              | Force a full source replay before candidate selection      | Off        |
| `--max-auto-grade <n>`      | Max ungraded skills to auto-grade per run (0 to disable)   | `5`        |
| `--loop`                    | Run as a long-lived process that cycles continuously       | Off        |
| `--loop-interval <seconds>` | Pause between cycles (minimum 60)                          | `3600`     |
| `--help`                    | Show command help                                          | Off        |

## Default Behavior

- Sync source-truth telemetry first
- Auto-grade up to 5 ungraded skills that have session data (enables evolution on first run after ingest)
- Prioritize critical/warning/ungraded skills with real missed-query signal
- Select package-level search for skills with package evaluation evidence; fall back to description-level evolve otherwise
- Deploy validated low-risk description changes automatically
- Auto-grade and write grading baselines for freshly deployed skills
- Generate review-first new skill proposals from strong workflow patterns
- Watch recent deployments (including freshly deployed skills in same run) and roll back regressions automatically
- Monitor grade regression alongside trigger regression during watch
- Upload personal telemetry to cloud (alpha users)
- Flush staged creator-directed contribution signals for opted-in skills

Use `--review-required` only when you want a stricter policy for a specific run.

## Common Patterns

**User asks to improve skills or run the full loop**

> Run `selftune run`. Parse the JSON output from stdout and the
> phased report from stderr. Report the summary to the user.

**User wants to preview changes before deploying**

> Run `selftune run --dry-run`. Report the planned actions without
> making any changes.

**User wants to focus on a single skill**

> Run `selftune run --skill <name>`. This limits the loop to the
> specified skill only.

**User wants manual review before deployment**

> Run `selftune run --review-required`. Validated changes stay in
> review mode instead of auto-deploying.

**Agent needs fresh source data before orchestrating**

> Run `selftune run --sync-force`. This forces a full source replay
> before candidate selection.

## Output

### Human-readable report (stderr)

A phased decision report printed to stderr so you can see exactly what happened and why:

1. **Phase 1: Sync** — which sources were scanned, how many records synced, repair counts
2. **Phase 2: Status** — skill count, system health, breakdown by status category
3. **Auto-grade** — how many ungraded skills were graded (logged to stderr, included in summary)
4. **Phase 3: Skill Decisions** — each skill with its action (EVOLVE / WATCH / SKIP) and reason
5. **Phase 4: Evolution Results** — validation pass-rate changes (before → after), deployment status
6. **Phase 5: Watch** — post-deploy monitoring with alert and rollback indicators
7. **Summary** — auto-graded/evaluated/deployed/watched/skipped counts and elapsed time

A mode banner at the top shows DRY RUN, REVIEW, or AUTONOMOUS with rerun hints when applicable.

### JSON output (stdout)

Machine-readable JSON with the summary fields plus a `decisions` array containing per-skill:

- `skill`, `action`, `reason`
- `deployed`, `evolveReason`, `validation` (before/after pass rates, improved flag) — when evolved
- `alert`, `rolledBack`, `passRate`, `recommendation` — when watched
- `freshlyWatchedSkills` — array of skill names that were deployed and watched in the same run

This is the recommended runtime for recurring autonomous scheduling.

## Two Execution Contexts

`selftune orchestrate` runs in two contexts with different callers:

| Context              | Caller                                | Token cost                                            | When                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Interactive**      | Agent (user says "improve my skills") | Uses agent subscription                               | On demand             |
| **Automated (cron)** | OS scheduler (cron/launchd/systemd)   | No agent session; LLM cost only if evolution triggers | Every 6 hours         |
| **Automated (loop)** | `selftune orchestrate --loop`         | No agent session; LLM cost only if evolution triggers | Configurable interval |

In automated mode, the OS calls the CLI binary directly. No agent session
is created. Outside of the regular sync/status/candidate-selection logic,
LLM calls can come from auto-grading ungraded skills and from the evolution
step itself. By default, orchestrate runs proposal generation and validation
on `haiku`, then re-runs the final gate on `sonnet` before deploy. Risky
candidates are escalated to `opus` with `high` effort for the gate only.

**Cron mode:** Install OS-level scheduling with `selftune cron setup`.
Runs as separate invocations on a schedule (default: every 6 hours).

**Loop mode:** Run `selftune orchestrate --loop` for a long-running process
that cycles continuously. Use `--loop-interval <seconds>` to set the pause
between cycles (default: 3600s / 1 hour, minimum: 60s). Stop with Ctrl+C
or SIGTERM — the current cycle finishes before exit.

### Signal-Reactive Trigger

When improvement signals are detected during a session (corrections, explicit
requests, manual invocations), the `session-stop` hook automatically spawns a
focused `selftune orchestrate --max-skills 2` run in the background. This
reactive path complements the scheduled cron/loop modes by responding to signals
immediately after the session that produced them.

Guard rails:

- Only spawns if unconsumed signals exist in `improvement_signals.jsonl`
- Respects the orchestrate lock file — skips if another run started within 30 minutes
- Fire-and-forget: the hook exits immediately, orchestrate runs independently
- Silent failure: any error is swallowed so the hook never blocks Claude

### Internal Workflow Chain (Autonomous Mode)

In autonomous mode, orchestrate calls sub-workflows in this fixed order:

1. **Sync** — refresh source-truth telemetry across all supported agents (`selftune sync`)
2. **Status** — compute skill health using existing grade results (reads `grading.json` outputs from previous sessions)
3. **Auto-grade** — grade up to `--max-auto-grade` (default 5) ungraded skills that have session data but no grades yet. Skipped during `--dry-run` (grading makes LLM calls). After grading, status is recomputed so candidate selection sees updated grades. Fail-open: individual grading errors are logged but never block the loop.
4. **Scope selection** — for each candidate, orchestrate decides whether to run description-level evolve or package-level search. The decision is evidence-driven: when an accepted package frontier exists or the canonical package evaluation shows room for improvement (weak replay, low baseline lift, or body/routing regressions), orchestrate prefers package search. Skills without package evaluation evidence fall back to description-level evolve. This selection happens automatically; there is no flag to force it.
5. **Evolve or Package Search** — description-level candidates run the existing evolve path (pre-flight skipped; Pareto mode uses 3 candidates; cheap-loop uses `haiku` for proposal + validation and `sonnet` for the final gate; adaptive gate escalation promotes risky proposals to `opus` + `high` effort; baseline and token-efficiency stay off). Package-level candidates run bounded search: generate bounded mutations on routing and body surfaces, fingerprint each variant, evaluate through the package evaluator against the accepted frontier parent, and apply the winning candidate back into the draft package.
6. **Post-deploy grade + baseline** — for each freshly deployed skill, grade the most recent session and write a grading baseline to SQLite (`grading_baselines` table). The baseline records the measured pass rate and sample size, anchoring future grade regression detection. Fail-open: individual grading errors are logged but never block the loop.
7. **Watch** — monitor recently evolved skills (auto-rollback enabled by default, `--recent-window` hours lookback). Skills freshly deployed in this run are included in the watch set immediately, so they are monitored in the same orchestrate cycle rather than waiting for the next run. These appear in `freshlyWatchedSkills` in the output. Grade watch (`enableGradeWatch: true`) runs alongside trigger regression for all watched skills. Watch trust scoring feeds back into scope selection: observed regressions can demote accepted frontier candidates, influencing whether future runs prefer package search or description evolve for that skill.
8. **Workflow proposals** — discover repeated multi-skill patterns and create review-first `new_skill` proposals when a workflow is strong enough to merit codification. These are never auto-deployed; they are surfaced as proposals for review.
9. **Alpha Upload** — if enrolled in the alpha program (`config.alpha.enrolled === true`) and an API key is configured, stage new canonical records (sessions, invocations, evolution evidence, orchestrate runs) into `canonical_upload_staging`, build V2 push payloads, and flush to the cloud API (`POST /api/v1/push`) with Bearer auth. Fail-open: upload errors never block the orchestrate loop. Respects `--dry-run`.
10. **Contribution relay flush** — if an API key is configured, flush any staged creator-directed contribution signals for opted-in skills. Fail-open: relay errors never block the orchestrate loop. Respects `--dry-run`.

### Package Search in Orchestrate

When orchestrate selects a candidate for package-level improvement, it
delegates to the same bounded search flow available through
`selftune improve --scope package` or `selftune search-run`. The flow is:

1. **Generate bounded mutations** on routing and body surfaces using
   eval-informed targeted variants first, then deterministic fallback
   transforms, biasing the candidate budget toward the weaker measured surface
   from the accepted frontier or canonical package evaluation.
2. **Fingerprint** each variant to skip duplicates already in the candidate
   registry.
3. **Evaluate** each variant through the package evaluator against the
   accepted frontier parent, comparing replay, baseline lift, routing
   validation, body validation, and unit-test results.
4. **Select winner** based on the highest positive measured delta across the
   full evaluator contract (not replay-only).
5. **Apply winner** back into the draft package and refresh the canonical
   package-evaluation artifact from the accepted candidate cache.
6. **Continue** to the watch phase, where post-deploy evidence can demote
   the accepted frontier candidate if regressions are observed.

Package search does not replace description evolve. It is selected
automatically when the evidence points to package-level improvement
opportunity. Skills without package evaluation history continue through
description-level evolve as before.

When orchestrate invokes evolve for a selected candidate, it always passes
`confidenceThreshold: 0.6` and `maxIterations: 3`, plus the autonomous evolve
defaults listed above. Those defaults are the recurring-run policy for the
autonomy-first loop; there are no orchestrate flags to override them per run.

Between candidate selection and evolution, orchestrate checks for
**cross-skill eval set overlap**. When two or more evolution candidates
share >30% of their positive eval queries, a warning is logged to stderr.
This is an informational diagnostic only — it does not block evolution.

All sub-workflows run with defaults and no user interaction. The safety
model relies on regression thresholds, automatic rollback, and SKILL.md
backups rather than human confirmation.
