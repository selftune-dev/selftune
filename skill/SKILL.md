# selftune

Observe real agent sessions, detect missed triggers, grade execution quality,
and evolve skill descriptions toward the language real users actually use.

## Bootstrap

If `~/.selftune/config.json` does not exist, read `Workflows/Initialize.md`
first. The CLI must be installed (`selftune` on PATH) before other commands
will work. Do not proceed with other commands until initialization is complete.

## Command Execution Policy

```bash
selftune <command> [options]
```

Most commands output deterministic JSON. Parse JSON output for machine-readable commands.
`selftune dashboard` is an exception: `--export` generates an HTML artifact, while
`--serve` starts a local server; both may print informational progress lines.

## Interactive Configuration

Before running mutating workflows (evolve, evolve-body, evals, baseline), present
a pre-flight configuration prompt to the user. This gives them control over
execution mode, model selection, and key parameters.

### Pre-Flight Pattern

Each mutating workflow has a **Pre-Flight Configuration** step. Follow this pattern:

1. Present a summary of what the command will do
2. Show numbered options with `(recommended)` markers for suggested defaults
3. Ask the user to pick options or say "use defaults" / "go with defaults"
4. Show a confirmation summary of selected options before executing

### Model Tier Reference

When presenting model choices, use this table:

| Tier | Model | Speed | Cost | Quality | Best for |
|------|-------|-------|------|---------|----------|
| Fast | `haiku` | ~2s/call | $ | Good | Iteration loops, bulk validation |
| Balanced | `sonnet` | ~5s/call | $$ | Great | Single-pass proposals, gate checks |
| Best | `opus` | ~10s/call | $$$ | Excellent | High-stakes final validation |

### Quick Path

If the user says "use defaults", "just do it", or similar — skip the pre-flight
and run with recommended defaults. The pre-flight is for users who want control,
not a mandatory gate.

### Workflows That Skip Pre-Flight

These read-only or simple workflows run immediately without prompting:
`status`, `last`, `doctor`, `dashboard`, `watch`, `evolve rollback`,
`grade auto`, `ingest *`, `contribute`, `cron`, `eval composability`,
`eval unit-test`, `eval import`.

## The Feedback Loop

```
Observe --> Detect --> Diagnose --> Propose --> Validate --> Audit --> Deploy --> Watch --> Rollback
   |                                                                    |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

1. **Observe** -- Hooks capture every session (queries, triggers, metrics)
2. **Detect** -- `selftune eval generate` extracts missed-trigger patterns across invocation types
3. **Diagnose** -- `selftune grade` evaluates session quality with evidence
4. **Propose** -- `selftune evolve` generates description improvements
5. **Validate** -- Evolution is tested against the eval set
6. **Audit** -- Persist proposal, evidence, and decision metadata for traceability
7. **Deploy** -- Updated description replaces the original (with backup)
8. **Watch** -- `selftune watch` monitors for regressions post-deploy
9. **Rollback** -- `selftune evolve rollback` restores the previous version when regressions are detected

## Specialized Agents

selftune provides focused agents for deeper analysis. These live in
`.claude/agents/` and can be spawned as subagents for specialized tasks.

| Trigger keywords | Agent | Purpose |
|------------------|-------|---------|
| diagnose, root cause, why failing, skill failure, debug performance | diagnosis-analyst | Deep-dive analysis of underperforming skills |
| patterns, conflicts, cross-skill, overlap, trigger conflicts, optimize skills | pattern-analyst | Cross-skill pattern analysis and conflict detection |
| review evolution, check proposal, safe to deploy, approve evolution | evolution-reviewer | Safety gate review of pending evolution proposals |
| set up selftune, integrate, configure project, install selftune | integration-guide | Guided interactive setup for specific project types |

## Examples

- "Grade my last pptx session"
- "What skills are undertriggering?"
- "Generate evals for the pptx skill"
- "Evolve the pptx skill to catch more queries"
- "Rollback the last evolution"
- "Is the skill performing well after the change?"
- "Check selftune health"
- "Ingest my codex logs"
- "Show me skill stats"
- "How are my skills performing?"
- "What happened in my last session?"
- "Open the selftune dashboard"
- "Serve the dashboard at http://localhost:3141"
- "Show skill health status"
- "Replay my Claude Code transcripts"
- "Backfill logs from historical sessions"
- "Contribute my selftune data to the community"
- "Share anonymized skill data"
- "Set up cron jobs for autonomous evolution"
- "Schedule selftune to run automatically"
- "Ingest my OpenClaw sessions"
- "Why is selftune suggesting things?"
- "Customize activation rules"
- "Start the live dashboard"
- "Serve the dashboard on port 8080"
- "What happened in the last evolution?"
- "Read the evolution memory"
- "Why is this skill underperforming?"
- "Are there conflicts between my skills?"
- "Review this evolution before deploying"
- "Set up selftune for my project"
- "Evolve the full body of the Research skill"
- "Rewrite the routing table for pptx"
- "Does this skill add value over no-skill baseline?"
- "Measure baseline lift for the Research skill"
- "Generate unit tests for the pptx skill"
- "Run skill unit tests"
- "Which skills conflict with each other?"
- "Analyze composability for the Research skill"
- "Import SkillsBench tasks for my skill"

## Negative Examples

These should NOT trigger selftune:

- "Fix this React hydration bug"
- "Create a PowerPoint about Q3 results" (this is pptx, not selftune)
- "Run my unit tests"
- "What does this error mean?"

Route to other skills or general workflows unless the user explicitly
asks about grading, evals, evolution, monitoring, or skill observability.
