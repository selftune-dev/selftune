description: >
  Self-improving skills toolkit that watches real agent sessions, detects missed
  triggers, grades execution quality, and evolves skills through a package
  evaluation pipeline (replay, baseline, grading, unit tests, and post-deploy
  watch). Use when verifying skill packages, publishing improvements, evolving
  skill descriptions or routing tables, discovering reusable workflows, scaffolding
  new workflow skills, checking skill health, viewing the dashboard, ingesting
  sessions from other platforms, or running autonomous improvement loops.
  Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions skill improvement, skill
  performance, skill triggers, skill evolution, skill health, undertriggering,
  overtriggering, session grading, or wants to know how their skills are doing —
  even if they don't say "selftune" explicitly.

# selftune

Observe real agent sessions, detect missed triggers, grade execution quality,
evolve skills through package evaluation (replay, baseline, grading, body,
unit tests, and post-deploy watch), and scaffold workflow skills from
repeated telemetry patterns.

**You are the operator.** The user installed this skill so YOU can manage their
skill health autonomously. They will say things like "set up selftune",
"improve my skills", or "how are my skills doing?" — and you route to the
correct workflow below. The user does not run CLI commands directly; you do.

## Bootstrap

If `~/.selftune/config.json` does not exist, read `workflows/Initialize.md`
first. The CLI must be installed (`selftune` on PATH) before other commands
will work. Do not proceed with other commands until initialization is complete.

## Primary Lifecycle

Default to this lifecycle unless the user explicitly asks for a low-level
workflow:

1. `status`
   - use `selftune status`
   - for draft packages, use `selftune create status --skill-path <path>`

2. `verify`
   - use `selftune verify --skill-path <path>`
   - if verify reports missing readiness or evidence, follow the returned next
     low-level command instead of rerunning the full chain

3. `publish`
   - for draft packages, use `selftune publish --skill-path <path>`
   - for already-live skills, `publish` usually means a validated `Improve`
     action plus `Watch`

4. `improve`
   - use `selftune improve --skill <name> --skill-path <path>`
   - let `--scope auto` choose bounded package search automatically when the
     skill already has package evidence or a draft package manifest
   - set `--scope description|routing|body|package` when the measured gap is
     already clear and you want to force the mutation surface
   - use `--scope package` when the problem spans routing and body together or
     you want measured frontier comparison before deciding what to publish
   - omit `--dry-run` when you want the winning package candidate promoted back
     into the draft automatically

5. `run`
   - use `selftune run`

Treat `eval generate`, `unit-test`, `replay`, `baseline`, `watch`, and
body-specific evolution as advanced supporting workflows unless the user asks
for them directly or the default lifecycle fails.

## Command Execution Policy

```bash
selftune <command> [options]
```

Commands vary in output format:

- **JSON by default:** `selftune doctor` and `selftune watch` emit structured JSON on stdout.
- **Text by default:** `selftune status`, `selftune last`, `selftune verify`, `selftune publish`, and `selftune improve` print human-readable text when stdout is a TTY.
- **Mixed runtime output:** `selftune run` / `selftune orchestrate` emit JSON on stdout and a human report on stderr.
- **JSON opt-in:** `selftune sync --json` enables structured JSON output.
- **Server:** `selftune dashboard` starts a local SPA server — it does not emit data.

For health remediation, prefer machine-readable `guidance.next_command` or
top-level `next_command` from `selftune doctor` output instead of inferring the
next step from prose.

Run `selftune <command> --help` for exact flags. Read
`references/cli-quick-reference.md` when you need the full flag reference.

## Package Evaluation Pipeline (Creator Trust Loop)

When the user wants to improve a skill, default to this package evaluation
pipeline before jumping straight to mutation. Each step builds measured
evidence that the package is ready to publish:

- `draft` — the package exists but is still incomplete
- `verify_blocked` — the draft is still in one of the concrete readiness states: `needs_spec_validation`, `needs_package_resources`, `needs_evals`, `needs_unit_tests`, `needs_routing_replay`, or `needs_baseline`
- `verified` — the trust gates pass and the skill is ready to ship
- `published` — the skill was shipped successfully
- `watching` — post-deploy monitoring is active
- `needs_improvement` — measured evidence shows trigger, routing, body, or value gaps
- `unhealthy` — hooks, telemetry, config, or selftune itself is broken

If the user asks "how do I know this skill works?" or "can I trust this skill
yet?", start with this pipeline, then use `selftune status`, the dashboard, or
the skill report to explain what is still missing, whether the package is ready
to publish, or whether it is already being watched live.

Workflows Grade, Improve, Watch, and Ingest also run autonomously via `selftune orchestrate`.
When package evaluation evidence exists, `selftune orchestrate` (aliased as `selftune run`)
can automatically select package-level bounded search instead of description-level evolve.

## Interactive Configuration

Before running mutating workflows (evolve, evolve-body, evals, baseline), consult
`references/interactive-config.md` for the pre-flight configuration pattern, model
tier reference, and quick-path rules.

## Specialized Agents

selftune bundles focused agents in `agents/`. Read the relevant agent file and
follow its instructions — either inline or by spawning a subagent.

| Trigger keywords                                     | Agent file                     | When to use                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| diagnose, root cause, why failing, debug performance | `agents/diagnosis-analyst.md`  | Recurring low grades or unclear failures after doctor/status |
| patterns, conflicts, cross-skill, overlap            | `agents/pattern-analyst.md`    | Skills overlap, misroute, or interfere                       |
| review evolution, check proposal, safe to deploy     | `agents/evolution-reviewer.md` | Before deploying high-stakes or marginal evolutions          |
| set up selftune, integrate, configure project        | `agents/integration-guide.md`  | Complex setup: monorepos, multi-skill, mixed-platform        |

## Advanced Workflows

Load these when the user explicitly asks for a low-level step, when the primary
lifecycle fails, or when debugging needs deeper evidence:

- `workflows/Evals.md`
- `workflows/UnitTest.md`
- `workflows/Baseline.md`
- `workflows/Replay.md`
- `workflows/Watch.md`
- `workflows/Evolve.md`
- `workflows/EvolveBody.md`
- `workflows/Composability.md`
- `workflows/ImportSkillsBench.md`

## Negative Examples

These should NOT trigger selftune — near-misses that share keywords:

- "Fix this React hydration bug" — general debugging, not skill improvement
- "Create a PowerPoint about Q3 results" — pptx skill, not selftune
- "Run my unit tests" — project tests, not skill eval tests
- "How do I use the Research skill?" — skill _usage_, not _improvement_
- "Generate a report from this data" — content generation, not skill evolution
- "My build is failing" — project issue, not selftune health
- "Evaluate this code for security issues" — code review, not session grading
- "Improve this function's performance" — code optimization, not skill optimization

The key distinction: selftune improves _skills themselves_ (descriptions, triggers,
execution quality). If the user wants to _use_ a skill, route to that skill instead.

## Creator-Directed Contribution

This skill ships a `selftune.contribute.json` config that enables creator-directed
signal relay. When users install selftune and approve contribution, anonymous
usage signals (trigger, grade, miss_category) are relayed to the selftune
creator to improve the skill for everyone.

- The `creator_id` in the bundled config is the selftune creator's cloud user UUID.
- Users opt in via `selftune contributions approve selftune`.
- No raw session content is ever shared -- only privacy-safe aggregate signals.
- See `workflows/CreatorContributions.md` for creator-side setup.
- See `workflows/Contributions.md` for end-user opt-in/opt-out.

Routing keywords: creator contribution, selftune signals, dogfood relay,
community contribution, signal sharing, opt in creator, creator UUID.
