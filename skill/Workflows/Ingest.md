# selftune Ingest Workflow

> **Note:** Claude Code is the fully supported platform. Codex, OpenCode, and OpenClaw adapters are experimental and may have gaps.

Import sessions from agent platforms into the shared selftune log format.
Covers five sub-commands: `ingest claude`, `ingest codex`, `ingest opencode`,
`ingest openclaw`, and `ingest wrap-codex`.

## When to Use Each

| Sub-command | Platform | Mode | When |
|-------------|----------|------|------|
| `ingest claude` | Claude Code | Batch | Backfill logs from existing Claude Code transcripts |
| `ingest codex` | Codex | Batch | Import existing Codex rollout logs |
| `ingest opencode` | OpenCode | Batch | Import existing OpenCode sessions |
| `ingest openclaw` | OpenClaw | Batch | Import existing OpenClaw agent sessions |
| `ingest wrap-codex` | Codex | Real-time | Wrap `codex exec` to capture telemetry live |

---

## ingest claude

Batch ingest existing Claude Code session transcripts into the shared JSONL schema.

### Default Command

```bash
selftune ingest claude
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--since <date>` | Only ingest sessions modified after this date (e.g., `2026-01-01`) |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be ingested without writing to logs |
| `--force` | Re-ingest all sessions, ignoring the marker file |
| `--verbose` | Show per-file progress during ingestion |
| `--projects-dir <path>` | Override default `~/.claude/projects/` directory |

### Source

Reads from `~/.claude/projects/<hash>/<session-id>.jsonl`. These are the
transcript files Claude Code automatically saves for every session.

### Output

Writes to:
- `~/.claude/all_queries_log.jsonl` -- extracted user queries (one per query, not just last)
- `~/.claude/session_telemetry_log.jsonl` -- per-session metrics with `source: "claude_code_replay"`
- `~/.claude/skill_usage_log.jsonl` -- skill triggers with `source: "claude_code_replay"`

### Steps

1. Run `selftune ingest claude --dry-run` to preview what would be ingested
2. Run `selftune ingest claude` to ingest all sessions
3. Run `selftune doctor` to confirm logs are healthy
4. Run `selftune eval generate --list-skills` to see if the ingested sessions appear

### Notes

- Idempotent: uses a marker file (`~/.claude/claude_code_ingested_sessions.json`) to track
  which transcripts have already been ingested. Safe to run repeatedly.
- Extracts ALL user queries per session, not just the last one.
- Filters out system messages, short queries (<4 chars), and queries matching `SKIP_PREFIXES`.

## ingest codex

Batch ingest Codex rollout logs into the shared JSONL schema.

### Default Command

```bash
selftune ingest codex
```

### Options

None. Reads from the standard Codex session directory.

### Source

Reads from `$CODEX_HOME/sessions/` directory. Expects the Codex rollout
JSONL format. See `references/logs.md` for the Codex rollout format.

### Output

Writes to:
- `~/.claude/all_queries_log.jsonl` -- extracted user queries
- `~/.claude/session_telemetry_log.jsonl` -- per-session metrics with `source: "codex_rollout"`

### Steps

1. Verify `$CODEX_HOME/sessions/` directory exists and contains session files
2. Run `selftune ingest codex`
3. Verify entries were written by checking log file line counts
4. Run `selftune doctor` to confirm logs are healthy

---

## ingest opencode

Ingest OpenCode sessions from the SQLite database.

### Default Command

```bash
selftune ingest opencode
```

### Options

None. Auto-discovers the database location.

### Source

Primary: `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (SQLite database)
Fallback: Legacy JSON session files in the OpenCode data directory

See `references/logs.md` for the OpenCode message format.

### Output

Writes to:
- `~/.claude/all_queries_log.jsonl` -- extracted user queries
- `~/.claude/session_telemetry_log.jsonl` -- per-session metrics with `source: "opencode"` or `"opencode_json"`

### Steps

1. Verify the OpenCode database exists at the expected path
2. Run `selftune ingest opencode`
3. Verify entries were written by checking log file line counts
4. Run `selftune doctor` to confirm logs are healthy

---

## ingest openclaw

Batch ingest OpenClaw agent session histories into the shared JSONL schema.
Supports multiple agents and auto-discovers session files across all agent directories.

### Default Command

```bash
selftune ingest openclaw
```

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--agents-dir <path>` | Override default `~/.openclaw/agents/` directory |
| `--since <date>` | Only ingest sessions modified after this date (e.g., `2026-01-01`) |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be ingested without writing to logs |
| `--force` | Re-ingest all sessions, ignoring the marker file |
| `--verbose` / `-v` | Show per-session progress during ingestion |

### Source

Reads from `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/*.jsonl`. Each JSONL file contains:
- Line 1 (session header): `{"type":"session","version":5,"id":"<uuid>","timestamp":"<iso>","cwd":"<path>"}`
- Line 2+ (messages): `{"role":"user|assistant|toolResult","content":[...],"timestamp":<ms>}`

### Output

Writes to:
- `~/.claude/all_queries_log.jsonl` -- extracted user queries
- `~/.claude/session_telemetry_log.jsonl` -- per-session metrics with `source: "openclaw"`
- `~/.claude/skill_usage_log.jsonl` -- skill triggers with `source: "openclaw"`

### Steps

1. Run `selftune ingest openclaw --dry-run` to preview what would be ingested
2. Run `selftune ingest openclaw` to ingest all sessions
3. Run `selftune doctor` to confirm logs are healthy
4. Run `selftune eval generate --list-skills` to see if the ingested sessions appear

### Notes

- Idempotent: uses a marker file to track which sessions have already been ingested.
  Safe to run repeatedly. Use `--force` to re-ingest everything.
- Skill detection heuristic: identifies skills by checking for `SKILL.md` file reads in
  tool calls and by matching known skill names in assistant text content.
- Multi-agent support: scans all agent directories under the agents root, ingesting
  sessions from every agent found.

## ingest wrap-codex

Wrap `codex exec` with real-time telemetry capture. Drop-in replacement
that tees the JSONL stream while passing through to Codex.

### Default Command

```bash
selftune ingest wrap-codex -- <your codex args>
```

### Usage

Everything after `--` is passed directly to `codex exec`:

```bash
selftune ingest wrap-codex -- --model o3 "Fix the failing tests"
```

### Output

Writes to:
- `~/.claude/all_queries_log.jsonl` -- the user query
- `~/.claude/session_telemetry_log.jsonl` -- session metrics with `source: "codex"`

The Codex output is passed through unchanged. The wrapper only tees the
stream for telemetry; it does not modify Codex behavior.

### Steps

1. Build the wrap-codex command with the desired Codex arguments
2. Run the command (replaces `codex exec` in your workflow)
3. Session telemetry is captured automatically
4. Verify with `selftune doctor` after first use

If telemetry capture fails, check that the codex binary is accessible and that
the target working directory exists. Run `selftune doctor` to verify hook health.

## Common Patterns

**"Backfill Claude Code sessions"**
> Run `selftune ingest claude`. No options needed. Reads from `~/.claude/projects/`.

**"Replay only recent Claude Code sessions"**
> Run `selftune ingest claude --since 2026-02-01` with an appropriate date.

**"Ingest codex logs"**
> Run `selftune ingest codex`. No options needed. Reads from `$CODEX_HOME/sessions/`.

**"Import opencode sessions"**
> Run `selftune ingest opencode`. Reads from the SQLite database automatically.

**"Ingest OpenClaw sessions"**
> Run `selftune ingest openclaw`. Reads from `~/.openclaw/agents/` automatically.

**"Import only recent OpenClaw sessions"**
> Run `selftune ingest openclaw --since 2026-02-01` with an appropriate date.

**"Run codex through selftune"**
> Use `selftune ingest wrap-codex -- <codex args>` instead of `codex exec <args>` directly.

**"Batch ingest vs real-time"**
> Use `selftune ingest codex` or `selftune ingest opencode` for historical sessions.
> Use `selftune ingest wrap-codex` for ongoing sessions. Both produce the same log format.

**"How do I know it worked?"**
> Run `selftune doctor` after ingestion. Check that log files exist and are parseable.
> Run `selftune eval generate --list-skills` to see if the ingested sessions appear.
