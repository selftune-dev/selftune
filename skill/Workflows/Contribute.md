# selftune Contribute Workflow

Export anonymized skill observability data as a JSON bundle for **community**
contribution. Helps improve selftune's skill routing without exposing private data.

This is **not** the same as `selftune contributions`, which manages per-skill
creator-directed sharing preferences.

## When to Use

- The user asks to contribute data, share usage patterns, or help improve selftune
- The user wants to export anonymized skill observability data
- The agent needs to submit eval data for community skill evolution

## Default Command

```bash
selftune contribute --skill selftune
```

## Options

| Flag                 | Description                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--skill <name>`     | Skill to contribute data for (default: "selftune")                       |
| `--output <path>`    | Output file path (default: auto-generated in ~/.selftune/contributions/) |
| `--preview`          | Show what would be shared without writing                                |
| `--sanitize <level>` | `conservative` (default) or `aggressive`                                 |
| `--since <date>`     | Only include data from this date onward                                  |
| `--submit`           | Auto-create GitHub Issue via `gh` CLI                                    |

## Sanitization Levels

### Conservative (default)

| Pattern                | Replacement |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| File paths             | `[PATH]`    |
| Email addresses        | `[EMAIL]`   |
| API keys, tokens, JWTs | `[SECRET]`  |
| IP addresses           | `[IP]`      |
| Project name from cwd  | `[PROJECT]` |
| Session IDs            | `[SESSION]` |

### Aggressive

Extends conservative with:

| Pattern                                    | Replacement    |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| camelCase/PascalCase identifiers > 8 chars | `[IDENTIFIER]` |
| Quoted strings                             | `[STRING]`     |
| Import/require module paths                | `[MODULE]`     |
| Queries > 200 chars                        | Truncated      |

## Bundle Contents

The contribution bundle includes:

- **Positive queries** -- queries that triggered the skill (sanitized)
- **Eval entries** -- trigger eval set for the skill
- **Grading summary** -- aggregate pass rates (no raw transcripts)
- **Evolution summary** -- proposal counts and outcomes
- **Session metrics** -- average turns, tool usage, error rates

No raw transcripts, file contents, or identifiable information is included.

## Submission

- Default: writes JSON file to `~/.selftune/contributions/`
- `--submit`: creates a GitHub Issue with the bundle
  - Small bundles (< 50KB): inlined in issue body
  - Large bundles (>= 50KB): uploaded as a gist

## Steps

1. Run `selftune contribute --preview --skill selftune` to preview the contribution bundle
2. Parse the output and report the sanitized data summary to the user for review
3. Run `selftune contribute --skill selftune` to write the bundle
4. If the user wants to submit directly, run `selftune contribute --skill selftune --submit`

## Common Patterns

**User wants to see what would be shared**

> Run `selftune contribute --preview`. Parse the output and report the
> sanitized data summary to the user before proceeding.

**User requests stronger anonymization**

> Run `selftune contribute --sanitize aggressive`. This replaces identifiers,
> quoted strings, and module paths in addition to standard PII scrubbing.

**User wants to submit directly**

> Run `selftune contribute --submit`. This creates a GitHub Issue via `gh`
> CLI with the bundle inlined or uploaded as a gist.

**User wants to limit to recent data**

> Run `selftune contribute --since <date>` with the user's specified date.
