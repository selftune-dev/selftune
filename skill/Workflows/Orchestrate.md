# selftune Orchestrate Workflow

Run the autonomy-first selftune loop in one command.

`selftune orchestrate` is the primary closed-loop entrypoint. It runs
source-truth sync, computes current skill health, selects candidates,
deploys validated low-risk description changes autonomously, and watches
recent changes with auto-rollback enabled.

## When to Use

- You want the full autonomous loop, not isolated subcommands
- You want to improve skills without manually chaining `sync`, `status`, `evolve`, and `watch`
- You want a dry-run of what selftune would change next
- You want a stricter review policy for a single run

## Default Command

```bash
selftune orchestrate
```

## Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--dry-run` | Plan and validate without deploying changes | Off |
| `--review-required` | Keep validated changes in review mode instead of deploying | Off |
| `--skill <name>` | Limit the loop to one skill | All skills |
| `--max-skills <n>` | Cap how many candidates are processed in one run | `3` |
| `--recent-window <hours>` | Window for post-deploy watch/rollback checks | `24` |
| `--sync-force` | Force a full source replay before candidate selection | Off |

## Default Behavior

- Sync source-truth telemetry first
- Prioritize critical/warning/ungraded skills with real missed-query signal
- Deploy validated low-risk description changes automatically
- Watch recent deployments and roll back regressions automatically

Use `--review-required` only when you want a stricter policy for a specific run.

## Common Patterns

**"Run the full loop now"**
> Run `selftune orchestrate`.

**"Show me what would change first"**
> Run `selftune orchestrate --dry-run`.

**"Only work on one skill"**
> Run `selftune orchestrate --skill selftune`.

**"Keep review in the loop for this run"**
> Run `selftune orchestrate --review-required`.

**"Force a full replay before acting"**
> Run `selftune orchestrate --sync-force`.

## Output

### Human-readable report (stderr)

A phased decision report printed to stderr so you can see exactly what happened and why:

1. **Phase 1: Sync** — which sources were scanned, how many records synced, repair counts
2. **Phase 2: Status** — skill count, system health, breakdown by status category
3. **Phase 3: Skill Decisions** — each skill with its action (EVOLVE / WATCH / SKIP) and reason
4. **Phase 4: Evolution Results** — validation pass-rate changes (before → after), deployment status
5. **Phase 5: Watch** — post-deploy monitoring with alert and rollback indicators
6. **Summary** — evaluated/deployed/watched/skipped counts and elapsed time

A mode banner at the top shows DRY RUN, REVIEW, or AUTONOMOUS with rerun hints when applicable.

### JSON output (stdout)

Machine-readable JSON with the summary fields plus a `decisions` array containing per-skill:

- `skill`, `action`, `reason`
- `deployed`, `evolveReason`, `validation` (before/after pass rates, improved flag) — when evolved
- `alert`, `rolledBack`, `passRate`, `recommendation` — when watched

This is the recommended runtime for recurring autonomous scheduling.

## Two Execution Contexts

`selftune orchestrate` runs in two contexts with different callers:

| Context | Caller | Token cost | When |
|---------|--------|------------|------|
| **Interactive** | Agent (user says "improve my skills") | Uses agent subscription | On demand |
| **Automated** | OS scheduler (cron/launchd/systemd) | Zero (CLI only, no LLM) | Every 6 hours |

In automated mode, the OS calls the CLI binary directly. No agent session
is created, no tokens are consumed for the orchestrate logic itself. LLM
calls only happen during the evolution step (proposing and validating
description changes), which uses the configured model tier.

Set up automated mode with `selftune cron setup`.
