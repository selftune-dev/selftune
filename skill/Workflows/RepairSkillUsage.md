# selftune Repair Skill Usage Workflow

Rebuild trustworthy skill-usage records by replaying Claude Code transcripts
and Codex rollouts. Repairs the canonical SQLite `skill_invocations` table for
historical legacy rows, and also writes a compatibility/export overlay
(`skill_usage_repaired.jsonl`) that corrects missing or inaccurate skill paths,
scopes, and query associations from the raw hook-captured data.

## When to Use

- Skill usage data appears incomplete or has missing `skill_path` values
- The user says "repair", "rebuild usage", "fix skill usage", or "trustworthy usage"
- Before evolution or grading when hook data may be unreliable
- After changing skill directory layouts or reinstalling skills

## Default Command

```bash
selftune repair-skill-usage
```

## Options

| Flag                        | Description                                              |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--projects-dir <dir>`      | Claude transcript directory (default: `~/.claude/projects`) |
| `--codex-home <dir>`        | Codex home directory (default: `~/.codex`)               |
| `--since <date>`            | Only repair sessions modified on/after this date         |
| `--out <path>`              | Repaired overlay log output path                         |
| `--sessions-marker <path>`  | Repaired session-id marker file path                     |
| `--skill-log <path>`        | Raw skill usage log path (for path lookup bootstrap)     |
| `--dry-run`                 | Show summary counts without writing files                |
| `--help`                    | Show usage information                                   |

## How It Works

1. **Discover transcripts** — Finds all Claude Code transcript JSONL files under `--projects-dir` and Codex rollout files under `--codex-home`.
2. **Bootstrap path lookup** — Reads existing skill usage records from SQLite (or `--skill-log` JSONL) to build a skill-name-to-path lookup table.
3. **Replay transcripts** — For each transcript, parses the conversation to find Skill tool invocations, associates them with the preceding user query, and resolves skill paths via installed-scope discovery or the lookup table.
4. **Replay Codex rollouts** — Same process for Codex rollout files, using Codex-specific path resolution.
5. **Repair SQLite + write overlay** — Replaces legacy triggered skill rows in SQLite when safe, inserts repaired canonical rows for legacy-only session/skill pairs, reconstructs contextual missed triggers from `Read .../SKILL.md` evidence, then writes deduplicated records to the repaired log and updates the session marker.

## Output Format

JSON summary printed to stdout:

```json
{
  "transcripts_scanned": 42,
  "codex_rollouts_scanned": 8,
  "repaired_sessions": 35,
  "repaired_records": 127,
  "codex_repaired_records": 12,
  "unique_matched_queries": 98,
  "reins_queries_seen": 5,
  "reins_skill_matches": 3,
  "output": "~/.claude/skill_usage_repaired.jsonl"
}
```

With `--dry-run`, the same summary is printed but no files are written.

On non-dry runs, the JSON summary also includes a `sqlite` object with counts
for deleted legacy rows, inserted repair rows, and skipped pairs that already
had canonical data. Repaired rows can be either triggered invocations or
contextual misses reconstructed from transcript reads of `SKILL.md`.

## Common Patterns

**Preview repair scope**

> Run `selftune repair-skill-usage --dry-run` to see how many sessions and records would be repaired.

**Repair only recent sessions**

> Run `selftune repair-skill-usage --since 2025-01-01` to limit the repair to sessions from this year.

**Full rebuild from scratch**

> Run `selftune repair-skill-usage` without `--since` to rebuild the entire overlay from all available transcripts.
> This also repairs SQLite-backed skill invocations for legacy-only historical rows.

**Agent chaining into evolution**

> Run repair before evolution to ensure skill usage data is accurate: `selftune repair-skill-usage && selftune evolve --skill my-skill`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `repaired_records: 0` | No Skill tool invocations found in transcripts | Verify skills are being invoked in sessions; check `selftune status` |
| Many `(repaired:name)` paths | Skill not installed or path not discoverable | Install the skill or provide a `--skill-log` with known paths |
| `transcripts_scanned: 0` | No transcripts in projects directory | Verify `~/.claude/projects/` contains session directories |
| Invalid `--since` date error | Date format not parseable | Use ISO format: `--since 2025-01-15` |
