# selftune Initialize Workflow

Bootstrap selftune for first-time use or after changing environments.

## When to Use

- The user asks to set up selftune, configure selftune, or initialize selftune
- The agent detects `~/.selftune/config.json` does not exist
- The user has switched agent platforms (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode)

## Default Command

```bash
selftune init [--agent <type>] [--cli-path <path>] [--force]
selftune init --alpha --alpha-email <email> [--alpha-name "Name"] [--force]
selftune init --no-alpha [--force]
```

## Steps

### 1. Check if CLI is installed

```bash
which selftune
```

If `selftune` is not on PATH, install it:

```bash
npm install -g selftune
```

### 2. Check Existing Config

```bash
cat ~/.selftune/config.json 2>/dev/null
```

If the file exists and is valid JSON, selftune is already initialized.
Skip to Step 8 (verify with doctor) unless the user wants to reinitialize.

### 3. Run Init

```bash
selftune init
```

### 4. Hooks (Claude Code)

Hooks are **automatically installed** by `selftune init`. The init command
merges selftune hook entries from `skill/settings_snippet.json` into
`~/.claude/settings.json` without overwriting existing user hooks. If the
hooks are already present, they are skipped (no duplicates).

The init output will report what was installed, e.g.:

```text
[INFO] Installed 4 selftune hook(s) into ~/.claude/settings.json: UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop
```

**Hook reference** (for troubleshooting):

| Hook                       | Script                        | Purpose                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `UserPromptSubmit`         | `hooks/prompt-log.ts`         | Log every user query                            |
| `UserPromptSubmit`         | `hooks/auto-activate.ts`      | Suggest skills before prompt processing         |
| `PreToolUse` (Write/Edit)  | `hooks/skill-change-guard.ts` | Detect uncontrolled skill edits                 |
| `PreToolUse` (Write/Edit)  | `hooks/evolution-guard.ts`    | Block SKILL.md edits on monitored skills        |
| `PostToolUse` (Read/Skill) | `hooks/skill-eval.ts`         | Track skill triggers and Skill tool invocations |
| `Stop`                     | `hooks/session-stop.ts`       | Capture session telemetry                       |

**Codex agents:**

- Use `selftune ingest wrap-codex` for real-time telemetry capture (see `Workflows/Ingest.md`)
- Or batch-ingest existing sessions with `selftune ingest codex`

**OpenCode agents:**

- Use `selftune ingest opencode` to import sessions from the SQLite database
- See `Workflows/Ingest.md` for details

### 5. Initialize Memory Directory

Create the memory directory if it does not exist:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.selftune/memory
```

The memory system stores three files at `~/.selftune/memory/`:

- `context.md` -- active evolution state and session context
- `decisions.md` -- evolution decisions and rollback history
- `plan.md` -- current priorities and evolution strategy

These files are created automatically by the memory writer during evolve,
watch, and rollback workflows. The directory just needs to exist.

### 6. Set Up Activation Rules

`selftune init` copies the default activation rules template to
`~/.selftune/activation-rules.json` automatically. If the file is missing,
run `selftune init --force` to regenerate it.

The activation rules file configures auto-activation behavior -- which skills
get suggested and under what conditions. Edit `~/.selftune/activation-rules.json`
to customize thresholds and skill mappings for your project.

### 7. Verify with Doctor

```bash
selftune doctor
```

Parse the JSON output. All checks should pass. If any fail, address the
reported issues before proceeding.

### 8. Offer Alpha Enrollment

After local setup passes, always offer alpha enrollment before ending the setup
workflow.

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask:

- `Would you like to enroll in the selftune alpha program for cloud-synced analytics?`

Options:

- `Yes — enable alpha uploads and richer cloud analytics`
- `No — keep local-only selftune`

If the user chooses yes, continue with the Alpha Enrollment steps below. If they
choose no, explicitly confirm that local-only setup is complete.

## Integration Guide

For project-type-specific setup (single-skill, multi-skill, monorepo, Codex,
OpenCode, mixed agents), see [docs/integration-guide.md](../../docs/integration-guide.md).

Templates for each project type are bundled with the skill:

- `skill/settings_snippet.json` — hooks for Claude Code projects
- `assets/activation-rules-default.json` — default auto-activation rule configuration

## Subagent Escalation

For complex project structures (monorepos, multi-skill repos, mixed agent
platforms), read `agents/integration-guide.md` and spawn a subagent with
those instructions. That agent handles project-type detection, per-package
configuration, and verification steps that go beyond what the basic init
workflow covers.

## Alpha Enrollment

Enroll the user in the selftune alpha program for early access features.

Before running the alpha command:

1. Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask whether the user wants to opt into the selftune alpha data-sharing program
   Options:
   - `Yes — enable cloud-synced analytics and alpha uploads`
   - `No — keep local-only selftune`
2. If they opt in, ask for their email and optional display name
3. If they decline, skip alpha enrollment and continue with plain `selftune init`

The CLI stays non-interactive. The agent is responsible for collecting consent
and the required `--alpha-email` value before invoking the command.

## Alpha Enrollment (Device-Code Flow)

The alpha program sends canonical telemetry to the selftune cloud for analysis.
Enrollment uses a device-code flow — one command, one browser approval, fully automatic.

### Setup Sequence

1. **Check local config**: Run `selftune status` — look for the "Alpha Upload" section
2. **If not linked**: First use `AskUserQuestion` for the opt-in decision. Only if the user says yes, collect their email and run:

   ```bash
   selftune init --alpha --alpha-email <user-email> --force
   ```

3. **Browser opens automatically**: The CLI requests a device code, opens the verification URL in the browser with the code pre-filled, and polls for approval.
4. **User approves in browser**: One click to authorize.
5. **CLI receives credentials**: API key, cloud_user_id, and org_id are automatically provisioned and stored in `~/.selftune/config.json` with `0600` permissions.
6. **Verify readiness**: The init command prints a readiness check. If all checks pass, alpha upload is active.
   The readiness JSON includes a `guidance` object with:
   - `message`
   - `next_command`
   - `suggested_commands[]`
   - `blocking`
7. **If readiness fails**: Run `selftune doctor` to diagnose. Common issues:
   - `not enrolled` → re-run `selftune init --alpha --alpha-email <email> --force`
   - Device-code expired → re-run the init command (codes expire after ~15 minutes)

### Key Principle

The cloud app is used **only** for the one-time browser approval during device-code auth. All other selftune operations happen through the local CLI and this agent.

### Enroll

```bash
selftune init --alpha --alpha-email user@example.com --alpha-name "User Name" --force
```

The `--alpha-email` flag is required. The command will:

1. Generate a stable UUID (preserved across reinits)
2. Request a device code from the cloud API
3. Open the browser to the verification URL
4. Poll until the user approves
5. Receive and store the API key, cloud_user_id, and org_id automatically
6. Write the alpha block to `~/.selftune/config.json` with `0600` permissions
7. Print an `alpha_enrolled` JSON message to stdout
8. Print the consent notice to stderr

The consent notice explicitly states that the friendly alpha cohort shares raw
prompt/query text in addition to skill/session/evolution metadata.

### Upload Behavior

Once enrolled, `selftune orchestrate` automatically uploads new session,
invocation, and evolution data to the cloud API at the end of each run.
This upload step is fail-open -- errors never block the orchestrate loop.
Use `selftune alpha upload` for manual uploads or `selftune alpha upload --dry-run`
to preview what would be sent.

The upload endpoint is `https://api.selftune.dev/api/v1/push`, authenticated with
the stored API key via `Authorization: Bearer` header. The endpoint can be
overridden with the `SELFTUNE_ALPHA_ENDPOINT` environment variable.

### Unenroll

```bash
selftune init --no-alpha --force
```

Sets `enrolled: false` in the alpha block but preserves the `user_id` so re-enrollment does not create a new identity.

### Error Handling

If `--alpha` is passed without `--alpha-email`, the CLI throws a JSON error:

```json
{
  "code": "alpha_email_required",
  "error": "alpha_email_required",
  "message": "The --alpha-email flag is required for alpha enrollment.",
  "next_command": "selftune init --alpha --alpha-email <email>",
  "suggested_commands": ["selftune status", "selftune doctor"],
  "blocking": true
}
```

If the device-code flow fails (network error, timeout, user denied), the CLI throws
with a descriptive error message. The agent should relay this to the user and suggest
retrying with `selftune init --alpha --alpha-email <email> --force`.

## Common Patterns

**User asks to set up or initialize selftune**

> Run `which selftune` to check installation. If missing, install with
> `npm install -g selftune`. Run `selftune init`, then verify with
> `selftune doctor`. Report results to the user.

**User wants alpha enrollment**

> Use `AskUserQuestion` for the yes or no opt-in decision. If yes, collect email
> and optional display name in chat, then run `selftune init --alpha --alpha-email ...`.
> The browser opens automatically for approval. No manual key management needed.

**Hooks not capturing data**

> Run `selftune doctor` to check hook installation. Parse the JSON output
> for failed hook checks. If paths are wrong, update
> `~/.claude/settings.json` to point to actual files.

**Config exists but appears stale**

> Run `selftune init --force` to reinitialize. Verify with `selftune doctor`.
